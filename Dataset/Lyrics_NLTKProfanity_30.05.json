      "plain": "“Not Like Us” is Kendrick Lamar’s fourth diss track directed at Drake, released on the evening of May 4, 2024, less than 24 hours after the release of “meet the grahams,” his third dedicated diss. On the track, Kendrick avenges the West Coast for Drake’s controversial use of 2Pac and Snoop Dogg A.I. vocals on his song “Taylor Made Freestyle,” Drake’s second diss released via Instagram on April 19. It was removed shortly thereafter because of a cease-and-desist from the estate of the late Tupac Shakur.\n\nKendrick raps over a bouncy Mustard-produced beat which, typical of Mustard’s style, is inspired by hyphy—a genre of hip-hop popularized in Northern California’s Bay Area. In a June 2024 interview with Billboard, Mustard revealed that he heard the final mix when the song was released, the beat took him 30 minutes to make, and he talked about the inspiration for his production:\n\nWhen I was making it, I was, in the back of my head, is: What would Dr. Dre do if Lil Jon was in the studio and they was collabin' on the beat? That was my thought process.\n\nKendrick’s zany vocal inflections and fast flows are reminiscent of Bay Area legend E-40, a personal favorite of his who was shouted out on October 2012’s “Money Trees:”\n\nDreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)\nBump that new E-40 after school (Way after school, way after school)\n\nAmong other disses, notably calling Drake a snitch and culture vulture, Kendrick doubles down on prior allegations made against Drake of sexual deviancy. This time, he outright uses the term “certified pedophile” as a clever play on Drake’s September 2021 album Certified Lover Boy.\n\nThe cover art features what appears to be an aerial view of Drake’s mansion at Park Lane Circle in Toronto, Canada. Park Lane Circle is a “Toronto oasis where celebrities love to build extremely lavish mansions.” The thumbnail, edited in a way that closely resembles the sex offender registry which pinpoints convicted offenders' residencies, is continuing the thread of allegations made by Kendrick Lamar that Drake is a sexual predator. It insinuates that Drake’s mansion, nicknamed “The Embassy,” is a hub for illegal sexual activity.\n\nThe track was first teased on Twitter by two people: one of Kendrick’s associates and Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith, founder of TDE, the label and collective that Kendrick belonged to before launching pgLang. The first tweet stated that “[Kendrick]’s nowhere near done.” Top Dawg then posted, “Dot, I see dead people 💀,” foreshadowing the opening line of the song, which dropped approximately two hours later.\n\n“Not Like Us” became a massively successful hit song both domestically and internationally, breaking several records. On May 7, 2024, it broke the record for most single-day Spotify streams for a hip-hop song in the US, surpassing Drake & Lil Baby’s September 2021 collaboration, “Girls Want Girls,” which hit a peak of 6.6 million. The next day, it was reported to have broken the global record, beating out Drake’s single-day peak of 11.85 million with September 2021’s “Champagne Poetry.” On May 13, Billboard reported that the song would debut at the top of the Hot 100, making it Kendrick’s fourth #1 hit and first #1 debut in his home country. It did so with the chart’s release the next day, along with the news that it had broken the record for fastest hip-hop song to reach 100 million Spotify streams, surpassing Drake’s January 2018 single, “God’s Plan.” May 15 saw the song breaking the record for most Spotify streams in a week in the 2020s, surpassing Taylor Swift & Post Malone’s “Fortnight” from April 2024.\n\nThe first live performance of “Not Like Us” took place at Kendrick’s Juneteenth show The Pop Out: Ken & Friends at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California on June 19, 2024. The show was streamed worldwide through Amazon Prime and Kendrick performed “Not Like Us” multiple times to close the show as the stage filled with fellow West Coast representatives such as Mustard, YG, DeMar DeRozan, and Russell Westbrook, among others. The music video was shot in Kendrick’s hometown of Compton, California on June 22 and it premiered on July 4th.\n\nAccording to the Genius community’s end of the year rankings, “Not Like Us” was voted as the best song of 2024. At the 2025 GRAMMYs, “Not Like Us” won the prestigious Song of the Year and Record of the Year Grammy Awards along with wins in the categories of Best Rap Song, Best Rap Performance, and Best Music Video—sweeping all of its nominated categories. In January 2025, Drake sued Universal Music Group for basically promoting “Not Like Us” and its malicious claims. During his anticipated Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show performance in New Orleans the following month, Kendrick addressed the lawsuit by saying “I wanna perform they favorite song, but you know they love to sue” as a tease before he performed the first verse and chorus of “Not Like Us” before he closed his show with “tv off”.\n\nIn “Kendrick Lamar’s Inner Drive,” a Lamar interview with SZA in the October 21, 2024 Harper’s Bazaar, SZA engages this song directly, asking “What does ‘Not Like Us’ mean to you?,” to which Lamar responds:\n\nNot like us? Not like us is the energy of who I am, the type of man I represent. Now, if you identify with the man that I represent […] This man has morals, he has values, he believes in something, he stands on something. He’s not pandering. He’s a man who can recognize his mistakes and not be afraid to share the mistakes and can dig deep down into fear-based ideologies or experiences to be able to express them without feeling like he’s less of a man. If I’m thinking of “Not Like Us,” I’m thinking of me and whoever identifies with that."

      "plain": "On the ironically braggadocious track “HUMBLE.” Kendrick Lamar challenges his competition. It was released a week after the first promotional single, “The Heart Part 4,” with a music video directed by Dave Meyers and The Little Homies. It features religious imagery mixed with urban life, such as Kendrick in priest’s robes and a moving re-enactment of Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting The Last Supper—juxtaposing this with the concept of humility in the chorus.\n\nOn a religious note, the song could also be a reference to James Chapter 4, verse 7:\n\nSo humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\n\nThe beat features a deep piano riff and a banging 808 bass line. This style of production is a departure from the sound of Kendrick’s previous jazz-influenced project, To Pimp a Butterfly. It seems to reference the character Deebo’s theme song from the popular comedy movie Friday (1995). Kendrick is also shown riding through the neighborhood on a bicycle in the music video, similar to Deebo in Friday.\n\nThe song debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 22, 2017, making it not only the highest charting song for Kendrick, but also one of the highest debuting hip-hop singles since “Love the Way You Lie” by Eminem. The song later hit No. 1 on the chart on June 5, 2017, making it Lamar’s first solo No. 1 song and second No. 1 song overall on the charts."

      "plain": "“euphoria” serves as Kendrick’s highly anticipated response to Drake’s April 2024 diss tracks, “Push Ups” and “Taylor Made Freestyle,” which came after Kendrick targeted Drake and J. Cole on Future and Metro Boomin’s March 2024 single, “Like That.”\n\nHis first solo release since his 2022 album Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, this surprise dropped via YouTube on April 30, 2024 at 8:24 am Pacific Standard Time as a subtle nod to fellow Los Angeles legend and former Laker, the late Kobe Bryant—8 and 24 were Kobe’s jersey numbers. “euphoria” became available via streaming services a few hours later.\n\nThe song has three distinct parts, playing off his bar on the previously mentioned “Like That”:\n\nFuck sneak dissin’, first-person shooter, I hope they came with three switches\n\nKendrick’s tone becomes more hostile with every switch, and the instrumentation similarly becomes more eerie and aggressive. He attacks Drake on numerous fronts, including his behavior, psychology, life choices, public perception, and appropriation of and disconnect from an authentic Black cultural experience.\n\nThe single’s artwork is a screenshot of the definition of “euphoria” with two example sentences, originating from the online dictionary Merriam-Webster; euphoria became the most searched word on Merriam-Webster when the song dropped. The second example sentence is:\n\nThey had almost a week to recover from the euphoria of Tuesday’s series-winning victory.\n\nWith the single released on a Tuesday, Kendrick is inferring this track is a victory in their feud. It’s also speculated that the song’s title references HBO’s Euphoria, the popular teen drama that Drake executive produces. Incidentally, the show has been repeatedly criticized for sexualizing teenage girls, coinciding with the many rumors of Drake’s odd relationships with girls; Kendrick’s subsequent diss tracks “meet the grahams” and “Not Like Us” focused heavily on such allegations.\n\nNotably, “euphoria” temporarily crashed the Genius website when it dropped as fans rushed to decipher the lyrics."

      "plain": "This all-star posse cut showcases three distinctive rappers trying to out-stunt each other on the subject of fucking “bad bitches.” Rocky called the song a “reunion” of Drake’s 2012 Club Paradise Tour, which featured Rocky, Kendrick Lamar, and 2 Chainz as opening acts.\n\n“Fuckin’ Problems” began as a collaboration between Drake and 2 Chainz, when a line from the latter inspired the nascent song’s concept and hook. Drake and longtime producer Noah “40” Shebib, who were also working on a posthumous Aaliyah album at the time, interpolated unreleased vocal samples from the late singer to form the basis of the beat.\n\nAccording to Drake, the aggressive nature of the song was a response to Kendrick and those who tried to categorize him as a “soft” artist:\n\nIt was actually Kendrick’s record first. He had asked me to get on “Poetic Justice,” and again I was like, “Oh, ‘Poetic Justice.‘” It’s a great song, but it’s the typical, you know, “I’m going to be on the soft girls song on the album.” So it was like, “Let me give you some shit.”\n\nDrake submitted the song for inclusion on Kendrick’s good kid, m.A.A.d city album, but it was ultimately not included because it didn’t fit with the LP’s narrative.\n\nThe song finally found a home with A$AP Rocky, who released it as the second single in advance of his 2013 debut Long. Live. A$AP. According to Rocky, he was under pressure to deliver a hit. “The expectations for me [were] almost unfair, and unrealistic,” he says. “I just wanted [a song] to really back up that hype.”\n\nDespite its explicit lyrics and title, “Fuckin’ Problems” was a major success on radio, eventually becoming a top 10 pop hit and Rocky’s most successful song to date. A video directed by Sam Lecca and Clark Jackson, and featuring all four artists, was released.\n\nAfter the song became a major success, Drake reflected on his choice to give it away:\n\n\nMost people would be like, “Oh, we’re going to save this for six, seven months, until my album comes out.” For me it’s, well, I’m going to give this song to someone who is popping now. We’re all on tour now. It’s a big record. It needs to come out in the next two months. I made that personal decision.\n\nSure, I sacrificed the record. Maybe they’ll think I’m crazy. But I’m very present in the rap game even when I’m working on an album. What I do is pick five or six songs and disperse out and say, ‘This is going to keep me very much alive in people’s minds for the next year.’"

      "plain": "“m.A.A.d” is an acronym for both “my Angels on Angel dust” and “my Angry Adolescence divided.”\n\n“m.A.A.d” is also a reference to the 90s Compton based hip-hop group “WC and the Maad Circle.” The leader, WC, would go on to form Westside Connection, a group heavily associated with LA-based artists Ice Cube from N.W.A, and Mack 10.\n\nKendrick’s recent beat-down brings back early memories of similar situations, witnessing someone with their brains blown out at a burger stand back when he was 9 (probably referring to his Uncle Tony, or someone in a similar situation), he thinks he knows the person who did it but he censors their name. He also talks about how his cousin was killed back in ‘94.\n\nHe talks about his father telling him to get a job but he’s fired after his friends pressure him into staging a robbery. He gives his reason for why he doesn’t smoke when he tells a story of smoking marijuana laced with cocaine and “foaming at the mouth.”\n\nIn the final verse he tries to let the good shine through and offer respite for the youth and how they don’t have to succumb to the temptations and pressures of the street. He hopes that his experience and intelligence can do good for the youth living in similar situations."

      "plain": "“Swimming Pools (Drank),” the lead single from good kid, m.A.A.d city, addresses the psychological connection between peer pressure and alcoholism. What sounds like a club anthem is actually an introspective take on the social pressure and self-defeating attitudes that drive people to drink.\n\nThe theme of swimming in pools as a metaphor for drinking and alcoholism could be a reference to the 1964 short story “The Swimmer” by author John Cheever.\n\nK-Dot spoke to Complex about the inspiration behind this song:\n\nWhat better way to make something universal than to speak about drinking? I’m coming from a household where you had to make a decision—you were either a casual drinker or you were a drunk. That’s what that record is really about, me experiencing that as a kid and making my own decisions.\n\nThe radio version of “Swimming Pools (Drank)” ends here."

      "plain": "As explained in this, credits to Feeding Time of KTT for this summary.\n\nK.Dot recaps the story so far. He talks about robbing the house, “Home invasion was persuasive/From 9 to 5 I know its vacant.” He mentions fucking Sherane and bragging about it to his homies, “I fucked Sherane then went to tell my bros.” He references “Backseat Freestyle” when he talks about rhyming to beats, “Park the car then we started rhyming, ya bish/The only thing we had to free our mind.” And he talks about jumping dudes who looked like they had more money than them, “Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs/You looking like an easy come up ya bish/A silver spoon I know you come from ya bish.\" The line in the chorus “Everybody gon' respect the shooter/But the one in front of the gun lives forever.” is deeply important, not just as a life motto, but in regards to the events that later take place in this story regarding Dave and his brother. It’s also a reference to Kendrick’s Uncle Tony, who was shot and killed at Louie’s Burgers; this event is a snap back to reality from the “dreams of living life like rappers do.”\n\nA sequel to this song titled “Money Trees Deuce,” was released on Jay Rock’s 2015 album, 90059."

      "plain": "On “DNA.,” Kendrick Lamar adopts multiple viewpoints; celebrating, critiquing, and exploring his black heritage and culture. In the music video, Kendrick and actor Don Cheadle appear to trade bars, engaging in an argument using the song’s lyrics during an interrogation scene. We also learn that “DNA” stands for “Dead Nigger Association.”\n\nLamar is wearing a traditional Kung Fu uniform throughout the piece. In an interview with Pitchfork, Don Cheadle confirmed that he inadvertently inspired the ‘Kung Fu Kenny’ persona. Cheadle portrayed a Chinese-speaking martial artist named Kenny in the 2001 action-comedy sequel Rush Hour 2.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the video, the song “YAH.” can be heard echoing above—almost as if it is playing in Kendrick’s head as the camera pans down. “YAH.” comes directly after “DNA.” on DAMN.’s tracklist.\n\nFollowing his initial encounter with Cheadle, who seems to be portraying a law enforcement figure, the ending of “BLOOD.” suddenly begins playing; when Cheadle turns on the lie-detector device, he begins convulsing, almost as if in a trance. This snippet comes from the video of Geraldo Rivera criticizing Kendrick’s lyrics on “Alright,” one of his most successful singles. The music video also contains snippets from “Hood Politics,” another song from Lamar’s March 2015 award-winning album, To Pimp A Butterfly.\n\nLastly, the song’s second verse samples a different segment of the same Fox News clip from “BLOOD.” and it’s worth noting that “BLOOD.” precedes “DNA.” on the album."

      "plain": "Kendrick teams up with rock legends U2 on “XXX.,” which delves deeper into the political and religious themes heard throughout DAMN. In an August 2017 interview with Rolling Stone, Kendrick described how this song came together:\n\nWe had a [different] record we were supposed to be doing together. He sent it over, I laid some ideas to it, and we didn’t know where it was going. I just happened to have an album coming out, so I just asked [Bono], ‘Yo, would you do me this honor of letting me use this record, use this idea that I want to put together because I’m hearing a certain type of 808, a certain drum to it.’ And he was open to it.\n\nThe track itself seems to be a transitional moment on the album. Going with the original album play-through or the backwards play theory, in his path of wickedness, Kendrick begins to question the hypocritical ways of America after setting aside his Godly ways and overcoming fear. However, on his path to weakness, Kendrick continues on after “LOVE.,” where he expresses his feeling towards his significant other, and, on this track, Kendrick expresses what he would do to protect his woman as well as his immediate family, before giving his life to God.\n\nIn the first verse, Kendrick begins by addressing moral ambiguity, noting that even the best of us are capable of evil if the conditions are right. Kendrick brags about his accomplishments on the streets before a friend calls him for advice on the devastating death of his son—the usually-meditative Kendrick pushes him to take violent revenge. The second verse provides the worldly context for this violence, continuing the nihilistic themes found on “PRIDE.”\n\nIn an excellent piece of criticism, Steven Hyden notes that the lyrics of “XXX.” grapple with spiritual dislocation in America, with Old Testament overtones—something U2 has been doing for three decades.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Nardwuar the Human Serviette unintentionally predicted this collaboration back in March of 2012, before good kid, m.A.A.d. city’s release, when he interviewed Kendrick at the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas. Watch his response when asked if he would ever like to have a sleepover with Bono:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6s5vlQdQp4s?t=10m27s\n\nYouTuber Justin Hunte goes into depth in this video about “XXX.” and how Kendrick is representing his generation. He breaks down how the last verse of the song calls out America for its hyprocrisy in these lines:\n\nYou overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us\nGang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera\nAmerica’s reflections of me, that’s what a mirror does"

      "plain": "Kendrick Lamar kicked off May 3, 2024 with the surprise release of “6:16 in LA,” a diss track that followed his April 30 track “euphoria” and preceded a third Drake response—14 hours later, Drake would upload “Family Matters” to YouTube, which Kendrick then used as fuel to unleash the sinister six-minute track, “meet the grahams.”\n\nAs the title implies, Kendrick sends a personal message to each member of the Graham family. He exposes scathing allegations about Drake, many of which were never previously reported; for example, that he supposedly had an 11-year-old daughter and other unspecified children. Drake made light of the allegation to discredit it with an Instagram story post shortly after the track dropped.\n\nBeyond addressing the Grahams, Kendrick attacks other aspects of Drake’s character. He claims Drizzy is addicted to prescription pills—perhaps the ones displayed on the song’s cover—compares him to disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein, claims he has sex offenders on OVO Sound’s payroll, and that he is a sexual deviant.\n\nThis track’s cover art was removed for the streaming release, seemingly due to HIPAA privacy laws that protect individuals' medical records. The original cover art appears to be a zoomed-out version of the artwork that accompanied “6:16 in LA,” displaying items rumored to belong to Drake that were stolen from his father’s suitcase, according to a close source; namely, DJ Akademiks. Among these items are Ozempic and Zolpidem pills, as well as receipts of outrageous jewelry purchases. These items are resting on a multi-colored button-up T-shirt depicting a cartoon dog urinating on a red fire hydrant. Collectively, the image provides some proof that Kendrick really did have inside information, as previously implied on “6:16 in LA” and “euphoria.”\n\nThe shirt itself might also coincide with the name of Drake’s October 2023 album, For All The Dogs, which features J. Cole on “First Person Shooter” trading disses directed at K-Dot. Furthermore, this could be a subtle allusion to longtime rumors that T.I. let his friend urinate on Drake, according to a verse on October 2020’s “We Did It Big”:\n\nSo drunk in L.A., end up pissin' on Drake, shit\nFuck it, that’s still my brother\n\nThis is alluded to in the first verse, when Kendrick address Drake’s son, Adonis:\n\nNever let a man piss on your leg, son\nEither you die right there or pop that man in the head, son"

      "plain": "“goosebumps” is an eerie love song. Travis and Kendrick detail the unique feelings they have for their love interests—especially when she’s not actually there.\n\nBefore performing this song live, Travis says he “wrote this song in my bedroom at one of the darkest times in my life.” This, combined with the lyrics in the chorus—specifically such terms as “goosebumps,” “numb,” and “Heimlich”—have led many fans to believe this song may have an underlying theme of prescription drug withdrawal.\n\nThe track’s music video was debuted exclusively on Apple Music before being released worldwide on April 3, 2017.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dst9gZkq1a8\n\nIn addition, Travis broke JAY-Z and Kanye West’s record of performing a song the most number of times in a live show (“Niggas in Paris” in France 2012) when he performed “goosebumps” 14 times in a row. Incredibly, he proceeded to break his own record the following week."

      "plain": "The content of this song doesn’t advance the narrative of the album. It is told from the perspective of present-day Kendrick Lamar, who isn’t happy with the state of rap music, and strives to be different by maintaining his vision. He also discusses his career so far and how it has changed his life, for better or worse.\n\nKendrick explained this song in an interview with Complex saying:\n\nThat’s really one big subliminal at everybody getting mixed in a situation where everyone wants to have creative control. That’s the vibe I wanted to kill. That’s why I threw that record out. If you listen to some of the words, it’s real intricate, but it makes sense.\n\nThis song samples Danish electronic group Boom Clap Bachelors’ 2008 tune “Tiden Flyver.”\n\nOriginally this song was supposed to feature Lady Gaga. After the song was officially released, Gaga posted the original version on Twitter. Kendrick explained to Complex why Gaga didn’t make the album saying:\n\n“We had to meet the deadline for the pre-order date. That’s just the business side coming through and messing things up.”\n\nGaga was also supposed to work with Kendrick on the song “Partynauseous,” but that was never released either. The female vocals on the song are instead performed by Anna Wise."

His bold claims and aggressive lyricism led to an onslaught of response tracks and interviews from rappers looking to prove themselves.\n\nThe track was originally intended to be on Big Sean’s August 2013 album, Hall of Fame, but was removed from the final tracklisting due to sample clearance issues.\n\nJay Electronica’s verse is actually the second half of a much longer verse that he’s used in live performances, commonly referred to as the “Extended Control Verse.”"

      "plain": "“Poetic Justice” was released as the fourth single from Kendrick Lamar’s major label debut, good kid m.A.A.d city. The single features Drake, who was working on his third album Nothing Was the Same around the time this song was created. When asked by VH1 about working with Drake, Kendrick said, “My vibe with Drake is real cool.” The single peaked at #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #6 on the Hot Rap Songs chart on its way to double platinum status.\n\nKendrick explained “Poetic Justice” in a 2012 interview with Complex magazine:\n\nIf you listen to ‘Poetic Justice,’ it’s a song about a chick saying these legs are poems. On the back end of that, is really the Sherane joint, so it’s a dedication song for Sherane. And that’s going into ‘good kid’ and ’m.A.A.d city,‘ which completes the story.\n\nHe also said the following to VH1 on the set of the “Poetic Justice” music video:\n\nThis track was really bringing out the best of pulling out pure honesty on a track. We’re talking about specific people. That’s something [Drake]’s great at and something I figure myself at being great at, you know just telling the story.\n\nProducer Scoop DeVille sampled Janet Jackson’s 1993 single “Any Time, Any Place,” while the song’s title is a nod to Janet’s 1993 movie Poetic Justice—the single’s cover depicts her and co-star 2Pac in a scene from the movie. During a 2013 interview with Billboard, Janet Jackson was asked about her feelings regarding this song and she said, “I love Kendrick’s ‘Poetic Justice.’”"

      "plain": "“Alright” provides a moment of hope amid To Pimp a Butterfly’s battle to find higher purpose. After “u” – where Kendrick lays out his burdens – “Alright” responds by detailing how Kendrick means to escape his troubles. By trusting in God, Kendrick is able to look past his failures and have confidence that everything will be okay – “we gon’ be alright.”\n\nOn the surface, the motif is optimistic and universal, but the message is driven by specific pain and struggle. Awareness regarding the disproportionate police brutality against Black people has left many wondering if the US has made any progress toward racial equality. Rather than despair, “Alright” assures listeners that, through solidarity, “we gon’ be alright.”\n\nThe mantra made a strong impact in the 2015 summer of protest, as Black Lives Matter activists all over America chanted “we gon’ be alright” to mourn the countless black people killed by police in 2015 and provide hope for a better future.\n\n\n\nSome took to twitter suggesting “Alright” as a “new black national anthem” similar to “Lift Every Voice and Sing” and “We Shall Overcome” – also songs of hope emerging out of periods of despair.\n\n\n\nAt the 2015 BET awards, Kendrick performed “Alright” on top of a police car, further highlighting the song’s purpose as a protest against police brutality. The powerful imagery and anti-police lyrics proved to be controversial when Fox News’s Geraldo Rivera said:\n\n“This is why I say that hip-hop has done more damage to young African-Americans than racism in recent years. This is exactly the wrong message.”\n\nIn a video interview with TMZ Kendrick responded, driving the conversation back to the  problem of police brutality instead of allowing Rivera and others to change the topic to hip-hop, by saying:\n\n“… the senseless acts of killings of these young boys out there … This is reality, this is my world, this is what I talk about in my music. You can’t delude that. Me being on a cop car, that’s a performance piece after these senseless acts … Hip-hop is not the problem. Our reality is the problem of the situation. This is our music. This is us expressing ourselves.”\n\nTo give his message context, Kendrick worked with director Colin Tilley to create an extended music video for “Alright” – released June 30, 2015.\n\n\n\nOn February 15, 2016 at the 58th Grammy Awards, Kendrick Lamar took home five Grammys for his work on To Pimp a Butterfly. “Alright” was nominated for four awards, ultimately winning both Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song.\n\nThis song can be seen as the person tired of all the crying and feeling bad for themselves. They are now ready to take action and find a solution."

      "plain": "“LOVE.” finds Kendrick Lamar musing on the woman in his life; presumably his fiancée Whitney Alford, whom he has been in a relationship with since his high school days. Kendrick uses this ballad to ask the essential questions to his partner to solidify the most important aspect of their relationship: love.\n\nKendrick has kept his relationship with Alford under wraps for a majority of his career. It wasn’t until 2016 that word got out that he was engaged.\n\n\n\nThe title, theme, and smooth mood of “LOVE” completely juxtaposes the preceding song, “LUST” which is more abrasive. The titles themselves are complete contrasts, as the concept of “love” is the deep intimate emotion one feels for another, while “lust” encompasses all the physical and sexual desires. “Lust” is also one of the seven deadly sins."

      "plain": "In the outro of the previous song, “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe”, one of Kendrick’s friends asks him to rap. “Backseat Freestyle” serves as a flashback. The freestyle is not something present-day Kendrick Lamar truly believes in, but reflects the attitude and beliefs of young people caught up in a corrupt society (i.e. a mad city). According to legend, K.Dot recorded the track in just two takes.\n\n“Backseat Freestyle\" is being in﻿ the mind state of being 16 years old, and not having no cares in the world. Not giving a damn about nothing, but life and money and what you see in front of you. It’s not me talking now, it’s me talking then.”\n\nThis song was produced by Hit-Boy of G.O.O.D. Music who originally created the beat for singer Ciara. She never responded to him, so he sent it to K.Dot. Kendrick mentions Ciara in the album’s opening song."

      "plain": "Kendrick Lamar’s two-part masterpiece, “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst,” depicts life in an urban ghetto. From beginning to end, Lamar breaks down the stories that pulled him away from gang culture, while also speaking on his faith and the spiritual rebirth that provided him with an escape from the streets.\n\nIn the first part, Kendrick takes the perspective of two different people before rapping from his own perspective to discuss his trials and tribulations. In the second part, K-Dot picks up where the outro skit of “Swimming Pools” left off—Dave gets killed and his brother is seeking retaliation. The song closes with the same prayer heard at the start of the album on “Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter.”\n\nIn an October 2012 interview with Power 106’s Big Boy’s Neighborhood, Kendrick spoke on putting the songs together:\n\nBefore I became this person with a mature aspect on life, it was a dark place I came from, a place of negativity, a place of being unruly. […] I really based them two tracks together because that was a situation that happened that exact same time.\n\nEach part of the song is produced by different producers—the first half was done by Skhye Hutch and Sounwave. They sampled Grant Green’s 1971 record, “Maybe Tomorrow,” and lifted the drums from 1972’s “Use Me” by Bill Withers. The second half was made by Like of Pac Div, who sampled a vocal break from “My Romance” by The Singers Unlimited.\n\nKendrick split the music video into two parts for each half of the song, with “Sing About Me” premiering in December 2013, and “I’m Dying of Thirst” debuting in January 2014. It’s also worth noting that Lamar later mentioned this song on March 2015’s “These Walls,” off his 2015 album, To Pimp A Butterfly."

Kendrick received two Grammys for the studio version of the song at the 57th Grammy Awards for Best Rap Song and for Best Rap Performance.\n\nIn an interview with Hot 97, Kendrick said that “i” is the best song he’s ever written because he never thought he’d be in the mindset to make a positive song having grown up around so much negativity in Compton.\n\nThe up-tempo track once again delves deep into Kendrick’s personal perspective on the world. While premiering the track on LA’s Power 106, Kendrick explained the song is about self expression, inspired by the lack of self love on the streets of Compton. Though To Pimp a Butterfly revolves around spiritual turmoil, self-doubt, as well as negative temptations, this song offers redemption. The mixing and production on this version emulates a live performance, as opposed to the clean production on the single.\n\nThe track further explores subjects he already covered — and personally explained on Genius — in his song “Real” from good kid, m.A.A.d city:\n\nBut what love got to do with it when you don’t love yourself?"

      "plain": "This song is the first collaboration between Kanye West & Kendrick Lamar. The L.A. based artists swap stories on “No More Parties in LA,” playfully venting their frustrations with “rich people” problems and highlighting Hollywood’s greatest production: the fake celebrity lifestyle. Kanye’s verse has drawn parallels to his sophomore album, Late Registration.\n\n“No More Parties In LA” has its origins in the My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy sessions, where Madlib left five beats with Kanye, including this one:\n\nI just paint the scene of how I felt sitting there with Madlib working on these tracks and just hearing the textures.\n\nAfter the pair joined forces for Kanye’s Yeezus Tour and Kendrick appeared in the writing credits on Kanye’s 2015 hit, “All Day,” rumors and speculation began to swirl about a possible collaboration. The song’s snippet was originally released as the B-side to “Real Friends.”"

    "description": {
      "plain": "“Mona Lisa” is a story of a deceptive woman named Liz who sets her “boyfriend” up for a robbery.\n\nLiz is compared to the famous portrait painting due to the dubiety of Mona Lisa’s smile. The smile can be interpreted as disingenuous, which therefore makes Liz disingenuous as well, unbeknownst to the boyfriend. Wayne and Kendrick play the two sides of the story; Wayne is the robber and Kendrick is the boyfriend.\n\nThe song was originally recorded in 2014, as it appeared on the tentative Carter V tracklist that Wayne previewed in October 2014. The first snippet of the song was brought to light in 2017 when PharmaBro Martin Shkreli played a part of the song live on Periscope, after acquiring the album from a man who bought Lil Wayne’s Bugatti, where a copy of the album was left. The version that Shkreli played live was later leaked in September 2019, along with the rest of the original Carter V album.\n\n The song also notably contains references to Wayne’s relationship with Karrine Steffans, who is also known as Superhead. In an interview with BET Digital shortly after the song’s release, Steffans confirmed this, noting the song’s lyrics bared “similarities” to her relationship with Wayne."

      "plain": "“Wesley’s Theory” establishes the album’s theme by describing how racist American institutions upheld by white supremacy exploit Black creators for profit.\nThe first verse pictures a young Kendrick deluded by money, whilst the second is the perspective of “Uncle Sam” – a personification of the U.S Government and White America – trying to charm him.\n\nThe song’s title may be a nod to Wesley Snipes. The actor was embroiled in a tax fraud case throughout the 2000s and served a three-year jail sentence from 2010 to 2013. The U.S. Government stated Snipes was using “tax protester theory” in an attempt to get out of his charges."

      "plain": "“PRIDE.” is an introspective track that continues the album’s strong religious themes. Consider Proverbs 11:2:\n\nWhen pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom.\n\nKendrick delves deep into his own pride and his recognition as one of the best rappers alive causing tension between his ideals and his actions. The vocal pitch varies from high to low throughout the song, which reflects the contrast between his ideals and his actions. Pride is often considered the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins. It is the direct perversion of the humility that makes humans more God-like.\n\nThe stark contrast between PRIDE.’s beat and HUMBLE.’s beat is very intentional. “PRIDE.” has a very soft-spoken (humble) beat, while HUMBLE.’s beat is bombastic and in-your-face, each instrumental paradoxically contrasting the topic of their respective songs."

This knowledge does not come without some regret, as the song is largely a commentary on the prevalence of drug abuse in his generation.\n\nThe song itself utilizes a sample of “Knighthawk” from The Jet Age Of Tomorrow’s first album Voyager. The song also appeared on “Radio Los Santos” in the 2013 soundtrack for Grand Theft Auto V."

      "plain": "On “FEAR.,” Kendrick explores three instances of true terror at ages 7, 17, and 27, respectively. In the first verse, he explores the fear he experienced growing up in the hood with a strict mother.\n\nThe second verse interpolates Beanie Sigel’s classic track “Die” and explores the life of a teenage Kendrick expressing his fear of dying at a young age; especially with the rampant gang activity and police brutality in Compton, California. He takes a distinct turn in tone, rapping in a deep, monotone voice that denotes adolescent depression.\n\nIn the third and fourth verse, Kendrick revisits the anxieties found on 2015’s To Pimp A Butterfly: the lack of confidence in himself and his abilities, and the fear of losing the life he had built for himself; particularly at the age of 27. This notion may have been inspired by the familiar concept of the 27 Club, a group of famous artists and musicians who died at this age.\n\nThe fourth verse also acts as a thesis statement for the entire album, combining references to every other song on the tracklist. He goes beyond simply naming the tracks by addressing the recurring question from the album’s opener, “BLOOD.”:\n\nIs it wickedness?\nIs it weakness?\nYou decide…\n\nKendrick said that the verses in this song are the best he’s ever written, in an interview with i-D Magazine on October 17, 2017.\n\nAccording to Songfacts, he explained the veracity of the song:\n\nIt’s completely honest. The first verse is everything that I feared from the time that I was seven years old. The second verse I was 17, in the third it’s everything I feared when I was 27. These verses are completely honest."

      "plain": "“6:16 in LA” is Kendrick Lamar’s second diss track directed at Drake in their public 2024 beef. It follows “euphoria,” which released three days prior. It first appeared on Kendrick’s Instagram page at 6:16 AM Pacific.\n\nThe song may have been “bait” for Drake to respond with his following diss track, “Family Matters,” to see if he mentioned Kendrick’s family. When he did, Kendrick dropped “meet the grahams” 57 minutes later. Notably, the lyrics suggest that Kendrick Lamar has an inside man within Drake’s team, giving Lamar information about Drake’s plans and activities. For example, on the verse Kendrick says:\n\nHave you ever thought that OVO is workin' for me?\nFake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person\nEveryone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it\n\nThe cover art for the song is cropped from a larger picture which originally served as cover art for “meet the grahams.” It featured a glove with the Maybach logo on it, a division of car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, which shares a name with rapper Rick Ross’s music label, Maybach Music Group. Ross dropped a Drake diss track of his own in April 2024, titled “Champagne Moments.”\n\nKendrick initially threatened a second diss at Drake on “euphoria,” when he said:\n\n‘Back To Back,’ I like that record\nI'ma get back to that, for the record\n\nIn Drake’s infamous 2015 beef with Meek Mill, he dropped two disses aimed at Meek within four days—“Charged Up” and then “Back to Back”—not giving Meek any time to respond to his first punches in the fight.\n\nThe title of the track also plays off of Drake’s timestamp series, of which there have been seven installments in Drake’s discography at the time of this release. It follows a not-so-subtle titular jab at Drake in Dot’s previous diss track, as Euphoria is the title of the hit HBO Max series which Drake is an executive producer on; incidentally, Euphoria premiered on June 16, 2019.\n\nJune 16, 1994 is also the same date that the OJ Simpson murder trial was submitted in LA. This may add to the use of a single black glove on the cover art, since a glove was famously presented as evidence in the case.\n\nThe title may have several other potential meanings, whether intentional or purely coincidental, for example: June 16 is the birthdate of the late 2Pac, while Kendrick’s birthday falls on June 17; Father’s Day will fall on this day in 2024; June 16 was also the date of Kendrick’s first concert in Toronto. His 2011 tweet was even quoted by the founder of Twitter at the time, Jack Dorsey.\n\n“6:16 in LA” was co-produced and co-written by Jack Antonoff, a pop producer known for his collaborations with Taylor Swift. Antonoff’s inclusion is likely a response to Drake’s “Taylor Made Freestyle,” where he said:\n\nBut now we gotta wait a fuckin' week ‘cause Taylor Swift is your new Top\nAnd if you 'bout to drop, she gotta approve\nThis girl really 'bout to make you act like you not in a feud\nShe tailor-made your schedule with Ant, you out of the loop\n\nThe instrumental samples Al Green’s October 1972 track “What a Wonderful Thing Love Is,” which features Drake’s uncle, Teenie Hodges, on guitar. Notably, the sample has been manipulated to sound similar to “Boi-1-da”—one of Drake’s in-house OVO producers."

      "plain": "Inspired in part by a 2014 trip to South Africa, “Mortal Man” name-checks leaders from Nelson Mandela, to Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X and Moses.\n\nAt the back-end of the song Kendrick interviews the last King of Hip-Hop, Tupac Shakur. The two West Coast MC’s discuss black culture, racism, fame and image. Kendrick realizes he’s the new voice in a long line of leaders. Like Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr. and Tupac Shakur, he understands that he has a limited time, and when speaking with Tupac he knows that he has to reach out to the teenagers and recruit them to change the world.\n\nThe excerpts of 2Pac’s conversation with Kendrick were taken from a 1994 interview with the Swedish radio show P3 Soul, hosted by Mats Nileskär. You can listen to the interview in its entirety here.\n\nKendrick also shared his connection to Tupac in an interview with MTV, where he revealed the album was originally titled Tu Pimp A Caterpillar – Tu.P.A.C."

Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations That the caterpillar never considered Ending the internal struggle Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different They are one and the same '' What 's your perspective on that?

      "plain": "The sixth track on Lamar’s third album, “u” acts as a complete contrast to its lead single “i,” an anthem of peace, positivity, and prosperity starting with self-love.\n\nWith more melancholic production than the funk-influenced “i,” Kendrick peers deep into the dark caverns of his heart to expose the negative thoughts that plague his mind, at point referring to himself as “a fucking failure”. In addition to breaking the track down with MTV, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Lamar said the following about the record:\n\nThat was one of the hardest songs I had to write. There are some very dark moments in there. All my insecurities and selfishness and let-downs. That shit is depressing as a motherfucker. But it helps, though. It helps.\n\n\n\nAnybody reading or listening who may be asking these questions of themselves, just remember: from “u,” you will eventually reach “i.”\n\nIn The Oral History of Kendrick Lamar’s ‘To Pimp a Butterfly’, Kendrick’s engineer MixedByAli described the recording of the song:\n\n[The] session for “U” was very uncomfortable. [Lamar] wrote it in the booth. The mic was on and I could hear him walking back and forth and having these super angry vocals. Then he’d start recording with the lights off and it was super emotional. I never asked what got into him that day.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve 2015, T.D.E. posted a video on their Vimeo user called: “Kendrick Lamar – God Is Gangsta”. This video is a 2-part music video for “u” and “For Sale?”. T.D.E.’s verified Vimeo user was made specifically for this video. The video would later be posted on Youtube on January 13th of the next year."

Hit-Boy also produced Rocky’s first single from the album, “Goldie,” and the featured artist Kendrick Lamar can be heard on another of the album’s songs.\n\nIn an interview with Peter Rosenberg and Hot 97, Rocky explains why he chose these features, who had his favorite verse, and the significance of the track’s title.\n\nThe song hit the internet on the 18th of December 2012, the same day the entire album leaked and nearly a month prior to the actual release date."

      "plain": "“DUCKWORTH.” is a street tale about how Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith was planning a second robbery at a local KFC where Kendrick’s father, nicknamed “Ducky,” was working back in the ‘90s. The robbery could have resulted in Ducky’s death, but his generosity caused Top Dawg to refrain from harming him. This happened many years before Top Dawg would coincidentally sign a 15-year-old Kendrick to his label, Top Dawg Entertainment. Duckworth is Kendrick’s legal surname.\n\nOn the song “​untitled 02 | 06.23.2014,” Kendrick touches on his relationship with Top and how dangerous he can be:\n\nMe and Top is like a Kobe and Phil\nA father figure, fuck with him, you get killed\nFuck with me and he’ll kill you himself\n\nThe producer, 9th Wonder, samples Ted Taylor’s 1978 song “Be Ever Wonderful,” Hiatus Kaiyote’s 2015 track “Atari,” 1976’s “Ostavi Trag” by September, 1975’s “Let the Drums Speak” by the Fatback Band, and 1972’s “Mole on the Dole” by Climax Blues Band."

      "plain": "“tv off” is the seventh track on Kendrick Lamar’s sixth studio album, GNX, surprise-released on November 22, 2024. This song marks a reunion with producer DJ Mustard, who previously worked with Lamar on the acclaimed track “Not Like Us,” which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. This context sets the stage for “tv off” which builds on the momentum of their prior success.\n\nThe song reflects a call to action for individuals to rise above mediocrity, avoid toxic influences, and remain focused on their purpose. By metaphorically urging listeners to “turn the TV off,” the song critiques passive consumption and conformity. Other themes include: authenticity, accountability, survival, and self-sufficiency.\n\nIn a November 2024 interview with Billboard, Mustard explained that the two halves of the beat were put together at different times, with the first half being adjacent to him making the now-famous “Not Like Us” beat, while the second half stemmed from a separate, non-Kendrick project. Apparently, this portion was originally intended to be part of a planned theatrical album of his own before Kendrick expressed interest in it."

      "plain": "Up until this point in the album, Kendrick’s been plagued by Lucy & Uncle Sam. On his road to recovery, he runs into a homeless man at a gas station in South Africa.\n\nHe tells the story of a man asking for 10 Rand (approx. $1 USD). Initially, Kendrick says no and feels resentment as the man continues to berate him. After asking if he’d read Exodus 14, Kendrick begins to feel guilty and sympathetic towards the man.\n\nHis selfishness, towards which he attributes his success, eventually comes out most in his interactions with the homeless man. At that point, the man reveals himself to be God – his selfishness and unwillingness to give the homeless man a dollar has cost him his place in Heaven. This revelation harks back to the parable of “The Sheep and the Goat.”\n\nOn December 9, 2015, President Obama named this record as his favorite of the year."

The question is detrimental, paralyzin ' my thoughts Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all Got ta see how I 'm chillin ' once I park this luxury car Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo '' 20 on pump 6, '' dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo Twenty years ago, ca n't forget Now I can lend him a ear or two How to stack these residuals tenfold The liberal concept of what men 'll do '' 20 on 6, '' he did n't hear me Indigenous African only spoke Zulu My American tongue was leery Walked out the gas station A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion Asked me for ten Rand, stressin ' about dry land Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin ' He begged and pleaded Asked me to feed him twice, I did n't believe it Told him, `` Beat it '' Contributin ' money just for his pipe—I could n't see it He said, `` My son, temptation is one thing that I 've defeated Listen to me, I want a single bill from you Nothin ' less, nothin ' more '' I told him I ai n't have it and closed my door Tell me, how much a dollar cost? He 's starin ' at me in disbelief My temper is buildin ', he 's starin ' at me, I grab my key He 's starin ' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave And somethin ' told me to keep it in park until I could see The reason why he was mad at a stranger Like I was supposed to save him Like I 'm the reason he 's homeless and askin ' me for a favor He 's starin ' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser He 's starin ' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 'Cause now I 'm starin ' back at him, feelin ' some type of disrespect If I could throw a bat at him, it 'd be aimin ' at his neck I never understood someone beggin ' for goods Askin ' for handouts, takin ' it if they could And this particular person just had it down pat Starin ' at me for the longest until he finally asked '' Have you ever opened up Exodus 14? A humble man is all that we ever need '' Tell me, how much a dollar cost? Guilt trippin ' and feelin ' resentment I never met a transient that demanded attention They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin ' Sour emotions got me lookin ' at the universe different I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless My selfishness is what got me here, who the  I 'm kiddin '? So I'ma tell you like I told the last  Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines And I recognize this type of panhandlin ' all the time I got better judgment, I know when  's hustlin ', keep in mind When I was strugglin ', I did compromise, now I comprehend I smell Grandpa 's old medicine, reekin ' from your skin Moonshine and gin, , you 're babblin ', your words ai n't flatterin ' I 'm imaginin ' Denzel but lookin ' at O'Neal Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin ' focus And I 'm insensitive, and I lack empathy He looked at me and said, `` Your potential is bittersweet '' I looked at him and said, `` Every nickel is mines to keep '' He looked at me and said, `` Know the truth, it 'll set you free You 're lookin ' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit The nerve of Nazareth, and I 'll tell you just how much a dollar cost The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God ''",

      "plain": "The song where the album’s narrative truly begins to set itself in motion, Kendrick takes you through a vivid story of how he learned ‘Peer Pressure’ the hard way.\n\nThis samples the song “Helt Alene” by the Danish group Suspekt.\n\nThe fact that their mission is to complete a robbery without getting caught is really bad. Kendrick thinks that he should never have to be in the position to have to complete this sort of mission, although he’s influenced by his peers to think that this sort of “mission” is necessary when you’re a teenage boy in Compton. Kendrick now sees how unnecessary this was, and how he fell into the traps of peer pressure, as opposed to staying strong and not follow through with these “missions”.\n\nThe title of the song is a play on the title of the popular treatise by Sun Tzu titled The Art of War. A lot of this album is a study of human conflict and the nature of violence."

He finishes the song with the line “Y’all got ‘til April the 7th to get y’all shit together,” which is when TDE released the pre-order for his new album on iTunes. The song is Kendrick’s first single of 2017, which he initially teased in a now-deleted Instagram post the day before its release.\n\nThe sounds in the background at the beginning are present on DAMN.’s seventh track, titled “PRIDE.” The first beat switch at the 1:20 minute-mark is taken from track twelve, titled “FEAR.,” while the second transition at 1:38 is from track four, titled “ELEMENT.”"

      "plain": "The title “These Walls” plays off the familiar expression “if these walls could talk…” Kendrick’s complex wordplay introduces layered metaphorical and literal walls—the “walls” of a woman’s vagina, the walls of a prison cell, and ultimately the “walls” of his mind and conscience. Kendrick uses this conceit to explore sex, abuse, his own career, his enemies, and the human psyche.\n\nThe song narrates Kendrick having sex with a woman who has children with a man in jail for killing one of Kendrick’s friends. Kendrick views this as an act of revenge for his slain friend, but he also has a bad conscience about using his fame and power to seduce someone for that purpose.\n\nUltimately “these walls” represent being imprisoned by the entire situation: an allegory for a cycle of murder, lust, seduction, revenge and guilt.\n\n\n\nKendrick said “These Walls” was one of his favorites on the album: “It’s a record that I always wanted to make but didn’t know how to make.”\n\nVandalizing these walls only if they could talk\n― “Never Catch Me” by Flying Lotus\n\nKendrick may have been hinting at this track in Never Catch Me by Flying Lotus.\n\n“These Walls” won Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards."

      "plain": "The first song released from Kendrick Lamar’s Section.80, “HiiiPower” talks of self enlightenment through reflection and active work. It constantly touches on racial subjects, figures and conspiracy theories of today and the past.\n\nOn the official tracklist, the title is stylized as “HiiiPoWeR.” The second half of that can be separated into Po We R (Poor we are) which is a huge motif throughout the album. Poverty is one of the largest issues plaguing those living in projects as referenced in Section 8(0) of the Housing Act of 1937.\n\nAs described at the end of “Cut You Off (To Grow Closer)” (From his mixtape, O.D.), Hiii Power is a way of thinking with higher expectations, and achieving richness in body and mind. Essentially a quest for knowledge and wisdom of the body, mind and spirit."

      "plain": "From Team Kendrick:\n\nWhen rigor mortis occurs within a corpse, its muscles tighten, causing the body to become stiff and very difficult to move. The chemical reaction makes all blood gravitate to the areas of the body that are closest to the ground, leaving colorful spots as an indication of life that once existed. As the soul escapes, toxins remain causing the corpse to rot and decompose. This is the fate that Kendrick Lamar has deemed onto the competition, more commonly known as your favorite rapper. Amen!\nDeath can be so beautiful at times. Boasting bars as mad as Marilyn Manson, one grim rapper emerges to hold hip hop ransom. Hailing from Compton, Los Angeles, one of America’s most neglected graveyards, Kendrick yields his sickle (ballpoint pen) to pry open the caskets of lyricism, musicianship, and tradition. The emcee, once known as K. Dot, hence displays an air of irony in his verses, murdering the fraudulent with the same weapon used for shedding light on realness.\nSection.80 was released in the first week of July and continues to receive steady rotation from barbershop stereos to iPods on college campuses. A clear game changer, his debut album is dynamic in the sense that it brings forth the story of a generation incubated in the years of Reaganomics, while projecting the rebellious voice of a youth discontented by society’s harsh inflictions.\nDirectors, The ICU caught up with Kendrick Lamar at various locations throughout New York City to shoot this highly anticipated video off of Section 80. Accompanied by a triumphant three piece brass section, this funeral procession is not a mournful event, but rather a triumphant proclamation for a resurrecting art form. Chuuuch!\n\nThis track samples the Jazz composition “The Thorn” off of Willie Jones III’s album Next Phase."

      "plain": "Kendrick states in his poem that he dealt with survivor’s guilt by reiterating to himself that he earned his success and stayed true to his A-1 foundation.\n\n“Hood Politics” is just this – Kendrick giving us the outlook, again, of when he was a child/adolescent and didn’t have the knowledge he has now. This is a progression and also a contrast from the last song, “Momma.” The last song was about how he forgot how it was to be in the hood. This is him transporting himself to a time when the hood was all he knew.\n\nKendrick’s delivery on this track is at a higher pitch than normal to signify his younger self, his past, and his roots. On the record, he discusses issues such as American politics in the second verse and the rap industry in the third verse, with the latter being based on his observations of the stir caused in response to his “Control” verse.\n\nKendrick previewed the first two verses of this song on a freestyle with Big Boy on 92.3 FM. This song samples Sufjan Stevens' “All For Myself.” Legendary Funk bassist George Clinton, who was featured in “Wesley’s Theory,” remarked that this song was his favorite on the album."

      "plain": "This song is a counterpart to J. Cole’s rhyme over K.Dot’s “Alright” — both freestyles were released simultaneously on November 27, 2015. The two rappers have long been associated, as friends and musical collaborators. They have often hinted at dropping a collaborative project, though this has yet to come to fruition.\n\nKendrick’s release received widespread love, with some music fans suggested Lamar “renegaded” Cole on his own beat. The MC tackled trending topics like Kanye West’s bid for Presidency, Billboard’s top 10 rappers of all time list, and his claim to hip-hop’s throne. His first release since the critically acclaimed To Pimp a Butterfly, it employs a markedly lighter, though nonetheless “[un]mistakable,” approach.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JColeNC/status/670358893738913792"

      "plain": "The story opens as a flash-forward. K.Dot has known Sherane for a number of months by this point. He met her at a party where they flirted and exchanged numbers. They kept in contact with each other over the summer and got to know each other pretty well. He also talks about her family’s history of gang-banging that made him wary but didn’t stop him from hooking up with her.\nAt the end of this song K.Dot is driving to Sherane’s house in his Mother’s van, he has sex on the brain. But when he turns up Sherane is outside waiting with two dudes in black hoodies (possibly her two younger brothers, or her cousins, one of which could be Demetrius).\n\nThis isn’t the first time Kendrick has evoked the humanoid rat father-figure of the Teenage Mutant Turtles, Master Splinter. See: The Heart Pt. 2\n\nThe “Master Splinter” part of the title likely signifies Sherane’s “hoodrat” status."

      "plain": "“N95” is the second track on Kendrick Lamar’s fifth and final studio album with Top Dawg Entertainment, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers. The song’s title refers to N95 face masks, which have been one of the several key tools adopted to contrast the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout this track, Kendrick addresses futile and superficial coping mechanisms, while pointing out at the facades a lot of people have acquired, which he also discussed on the previous song from the album, “United in Grief”.\n\nSome fans interpreted phrases like “You’re back outside, but they still lied” and the refrain “take off” as the artist’s criticism of the way the U.S. government (first under Donald Trump, and then under Joe Biden) handled the state of emergency in response to the pandemic. However, in the wider context of the whole album, these references are more likely metaphors not just for people’s hypocrisy and “clout chase,” but for Kendrick’s own pretense and facade, as well, as he “took them off” in order to confront his “ugliness” and experience the first phases of his healing process.\n\nThis song’s bridge, alongside the first half of the third verse, were originally meant to appear on Baby Keem’s “vent”, but Kendrick ended up only providing vocals on the chorus.\n\nIn September of 2020, Kendrick was spotted filming a music video for this song, hovering over the beach. Two years later, hours after the album’s release, Dave Free teased the music video on his Twitter with a clip from the aforementioned shoot; Kendrick’s posture closely resembles that of Jesus Christ on the cross. This coincides with the religious themes found on Mr. Morale, as well as the cover art, where Kendrick is depicted wearing a crown of thorns.\n\nOn May 14, 2022, just a day after the release of Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, the official music video was shared on YouTube."

      "plain": "“Luther” is the third track on Kendrick Lamar’s sixth studio album, GNX and was later released as its third single. It marks his  sixth collaboration with his longtime friend SZA.\n\nThe title comes from the heavily sampled “If This World Were Mine” by Luther Vandross.\n\nThe song is built on lush instrumentals and effortlessly fluent lyrical exchanges, putting SZA & Kendrick’s notorious chemistry on full display.\n\nIn Kendrick’s verses, he raps about envisioning a world where pain and conflict are eradicated, replaced by light and empowerment for his lover, and how she keeps him grounded, level-headed and inspired. SZA’s ethereal voice provides a soulful counterpart, infusing the track with raw vulnerability and a deep yearning for connection and growth with her partner.\n\nThe chorus unites their voices, grounding the song and conveying the desire to uplift and to help their partner through trials and tribulations."

Centered around themes of sexual intimacy, Kendrick explores the monotonous routine of daily life for men, women, and those with fame and wealth, respectively. These lifestyles often involve desire of all forms.\n\nIn the second verse, Kendrick self-reflects on the unquenchable lust people in his position have for luxury; whether it’s unlimited sex, the ability to party with no consequence, or relief from financial burden. Ultimately, “LUST.” furthers the themes and narratives present throughout DAMN.—especially as one of the Seven Deadly Sins, alongside “PRIDE.”"

Yet at the same time, he was troubled by the bloodshed and incarceration of his peers still trapped in the ghettos of Compton.\n\nWhile he is separated and distracted by the fruits of his labour: the women, money, and fame, he realises the only way he can find a balance between the industry and the Compton homies he left behind is through TDE (Top Dawg Entertainment). His team has become his solace, and he’ll ride for them, the same as he would for those back home."

      "plain": "In the bible, Book Genesis, Adam and Eve are led into temptation by the serpent (the devil) and taste from the fruit that God had forbidden them to eat. This act, the fall of man, is the foundation of the Christian belief of original sin and the idea that all humans are born sinners—the concept of J. Cole’s 2013 album on which this song is the eleventh track.\n\nJ. Cole and Kendrick Lamar use the biblical narrative of Adam and Eve taking a bite out of the forbidden fruit as an analogy to modern day temptations, talking about the things we do knowing we shouldn’t.\n\nThis song samples Ronnie Foster’s “Mystic Brew.” A Tribe Called Quest used this instrumental in “Electric Relaxation,” and Kendrick Lamar used the same sample on his song with Jay Rock, “Enjoy Life.”"

      "plain": "While “King Kunta” shows Lamar at a high, confidently claiming his throne atop the rap game with the influence and success he has acquired, “Institutionalized” is the dramatic realization that the murky past of the m.A.A.d. city still lurks within Lamar’s psyche. Kendrick covers wealth’s corruptive powers, and how many people are negatively affected, almost brainwashed, by the idea of getting rich.\n\nHe also condemns violence and envy. Both of these are brought on by the institution of money. We are all at some level ‘institutionalized.’ The poor and disenfranchised are institutionalized by prison, racism, classism, and the rich and the powerful are institutionalized by fear, dogma, and the almighty dollar. Everyone is a loser in this game, perspective is the only answer.\n\nThe word institutionalized also has connotations of insanity. Those who are institutionalized are taught something is “wrong” with them, but perhaps it’s the institution that’s wrong."

      "plain": "“reincarnated” kicks off the second section of GNX with a continuation of the Spanish-language poem introduced at the beginning of the album.\n\nDriven by a sample of 2Pac’s “Made N****z”, the instrumental is a respectful resurrection of the West Coast legend’s legacy, contrasting Drake’s use of AI-generated 2Pac vocals during his beef with Kendrick months earlier.\n\nIn the song, Kendrick writes about artists to whom he feels connected both artistically and personally: his past lives. The first is John Lee Hooker, a revolutionary R&B guitarist from Michigan whose breakthrough single was released in 1948. The second, a female Chitlin' Circuit vocalist who achieved widespread fame and fortune but struggled with substance abuse, is most likely Billie Holiday.\n\nSince both these artists were in their prime around the same time, rather than explicitly suggesting that his soul inhabited each of their bodies before his own, Kendrick is likely suggesting that the black community today can inherit and build upon the artistic greatness of those who came before, while learning from their mistakes and shortcomings."

'' Everything I did was selfless I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them I did n't gloat, even told 'em, `` No, '' when the vultures came Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed Son, you do well, but your heart is closed I can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself Father, I 'm not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down '' But your pride has to die, '' okay, Father, show me how Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for I kept one hundred institutions paid Okay, tell me more I put one hundred hoods on one stage Okay, tell me more I 'm tryna push peace in L.A. But you love war No, I do n't Oh, yes, you do Okay, then tell me the truth Every individual is only a version of you How can they forgive when there 's no forgiveness in your heart? I could tell you where I 'm going I could tell you who you are You fell out of Heaven 'cause you was anxious Did n't like authority, only searched to be heinous Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent My greatest music director was you It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues It was harmony and motion I sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken Rehabilitation, not psychosis But now we here now Centuries you manipulated man with music Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving You came a long way from garnishing evilish views And all I ever wanted from you was love and approval I learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear The more that word is diminished, the more it 's not real The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel I 'm using words for inspiration as an idea So can you promise that you wo n't take your gifts for granted? I promise that I 'll use my gifts to bring understanding For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow? I vow my life just to live one in harmony now You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity And I 'm ashamed that I ever created that enemy Then let 's rejoice where we at I rewrote the devil 's story just to take our power back, 'carnated",

      "plain": "The song title “YAH.” refers to Yahweh (יהוה), which is believed to be the closest estimation to God’s actual name–in Hebrew, it was said as ‘YHWH,’ as they had no vowels in their script at the time. Jews used “Adonai” so they didn’t use God’s name in vain. The letters ‘AOA’ were put in YHWH, and became YAHOWAH. Kendrick referred to Yeshua on the previous song, “DNA,” and in his guest verse on DJ Khaled’s “Holy Key.”\n\nThis song makes other religious references as well, mentioning the Israelites and the book of Deuteronomy from the Bible.\n\nLike the two previous songs, “BLOOD.” and “DNA.,” this song references the Fox News segment that criticized his “Alright” performance at the 2015 BET Awards.  This time, however, Kendrick goes one step further and directly calls out reporter Geraldo Rivera."

      "plain": "“squabble up” is a West Coast-infused party anthem that showcases Kendrick Lamar’s unparalleled ability to combine infectious energy with sharp lyricism. Rooted in his California heritage, the track features elements of G-funk and hyphy, creating a dynamic and vibrant soundscape.\n\nThe title “squabble up” is drawn from L.A. slang, referring to fighting (similar to “square up”) or dancing, depending on the context. This dual meaning underscores the track’s themes of confrontation and celebration, offering a gritty yet electrifying energy.\n\nThe song’s release was highly anticipated after first being teased as a 15-second snippet in the “Not Like Us” music video on July 4, 2024. The track gained further momentum when Mercedes AMG used it to promote their Formula One season, followed by its inclusion in an NBA broadcast, solidifying its cultural impact. These moments helped “squabble up” go viral on TikTok, with fans eagerly demanding its release. The track finally dropped on November 22, 2024, as part of Lamar’s surprise album GNX, much to the delight of his audience.\n\nThe accompanying music video, released on November 25, 2024, enhances the song’s gritty, party-ready atmosphere with visuals that are a clear homage to Lamar’s West Coast heritage."

      "plain": "“The Heart Part 5” is the fifth installment in Kendrick Lamar’s “The Heart” series. It serves as a promotional single for Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers, Lamar’s fifth studio album, and comprises his first solo release since April 2017’s DAMN.\n\nThe track’s existence was first teased on April 19, 2022, when Lamar’s website was updated with a page entitled “theheart.” On May 7, 2022, the song was accidentally teased by Spotify through an updated description for their “This is Kendrick Lamar” playlist, but it was removed shortly thereafter.\n\nOn May 8, 2022, at 5 P.M. (Los Angeles time) the song was officially released alongside the music video. The visuals see Kendrick performing in front of a red wall before making several transformations into other famous Black figures using deepfake technology. In order of appearance, they are O.J. Simpson, Kanye West, Jussie Smollett, Will Smith, Kobe Bryant and Nipsey Hussle.\n\nThis song was added as a bonus track to Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers exactly two weeks after the album dropped."

      "plain": "On “BLOOD.,” Kendrick is shot by a blind lady he’s trying to help. The blind woman can be thought of as representing consequences of the damnation referenced in the Book of Deuteronomy. The duality of obeying God and being blessed, or disobeying him and being damned—giving into “wickedness” or admitting your “weaknesses” and submitting yourself to God—play a major role throughout the album.\n\nThe outro is sampled from a clip of FOX News reporters criticizing Kendrick’s “Alright” performance at the 2015 BET Awards. Kendrick later responded to the criticism on TMZ Live, saying:\n\nHow can you take a song that’s about hope and turn it into hatred? The overall message is ‘we’re gonna be alright.’ It’s not the message of ‘I wanna kill people.’\n\nKendrick talked about the song in an interview with Zane Lowe at Coachella, and he kept the mystery behind the song secret:\n\nWhat I can I say about that, without saying about that. It is… one of the most interesting pieces on the record. Man, I don’t even think I can find the wit… to tell you about that record, without telling you about that record. There’s a new life, its a new life.\nLowe: Is it the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning?\nI can’t tell you that. That’s what I can’t tell you. Come on now, that’s the whole thing.\nLowe: I had to ask though.\n(laughs) I know. That’s the whole thing."

      "plain": "This song denotes an incredibly important realization that Kendrick Lamar has felt. The song as a whole stresses the importance of loving yourself (and how this is a necessary component of having some of the powerful insight that Kendrick describes throughout the album).\n\nNotice how much lower, more controlled, and more mature Kendrick’s vocals sound on this song, as opposed to the higher, cracking voices he employed on the songs before (such as the immature anthem “Backseat Freestyle”), or the urgent tone used on “m.A.A.d city”. The song represents his decision to mature and his tone of voice is symbolic of that change he made."

      "plain": "On May 17, 2015, Taylor Swift debuted her “Bad Blood” video at the Billboard Music Awards.\n\nThe premiere was highly anticipated and featured a slew of notable actors and performers. It also doubled as a Kendrick Lamar-assisted remix, with the Compton MC dropping two previously unreleased verses.\n\nTaylor’s original song “Bad Blood” is widely recognized as a public note about her falling out with Katy Perry. In this context, Kendrick’s verses could be a take on his thoughts concerning his own haters. A popular Kendrick fan theory concerns his alleged beef with Drake. However, this rumour was laid to rest in an interview with Complex in 2014.\n\n“Bad Blood” was directed by LA-based Joseph Kahn, whose portfolio includes music videos with Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani, Muse, and Eminem. Kahn also directed Taylor’s “Blank Space” video. He shot to internet viral fame with his dark “deboot” of the popular children’s series Power Rangers in March 2015."

      "plain": "“Count Me Out” is the first track on the second disc and the 10th track overall from Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers. The track focuses on Kendrick calling out a once-significant person in his life who he loves to prove wrong.\n\nThroughout the song, Kendrick steps into a new chapter of his life, as a result of feeling obligated to open up more in his relationship.\n\nEventually, by the song’s outro he realises that he is too good for this person and that speaking his truth and leaving the relationship brings about much happier emotions within him. As opposed to the negative and miserable feelings he experienced mindlessly bandaging the mess he got himself into."

      "plain": "“Auntie Diaries” is the sixth track on disc two from Kendrick Lamar’s fifth and final studio album with Top Dawg Entertainment, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers; it is the fifteenth track overall. Kendrick tells the story of two transgender people, using this narrative to critique himself, society and the church’s views on the LGBTQ community.\n\nAt the end of the song, he alludes to the controversial moment in May 2018 when he invited a white woman onstage at the Alabama Hangout Festival to perform his October 2012 track, “m.A.A.d. city”. When she proceeded to say the N-word, he asked her to start over and avoid using the slur, however, she was ultimately forced to return to the audience.\n\nKendrick juxtaposes the misuse of the N-word with his own community’s use of the F-word to denigrate queer people. He uses these parallels not only as a teaching moment for his listener, but as a clever transition to the next song, titled “Mr. Morale,” which begins with the following quote:\n\nIt was one of the worst performances I’ve seen in my life\nI couldn’t sleep last night because I felt this shit"

      "plain": "“Mother I Sober” is the eighth track on disc two of Kendrick Lamar’s fifth and final studio album with Top Dawg Entertainment, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, and the seventeenth track overall. It features Beth Gibbons on the Chorus and Sam Dew on the outro, respectively.\n\nLamar opens up with heartfelt and personal lyrics, confronting his trauma head-on by describing his upbringing and the traumatic experiences that came with it. He details his mother’s experience with sexual abuse and her fear that Lamar might experience assault as well. Later on, Lamar asserts he was never subject to drug addiction, but rather lust. Lamar then feels a sense of despair and hopelessness as he opens up about cheating on his, at the time, fiancé. He sees his actions in the same vein as the actions of his mother’s abuser. He then describes the ongoing remorse and guilt associated with his mistakes.\n\nShortly after, Lamar broadens his viewpoint on the toxic, oversexualized culture faced by the African American community and how it must be brought to attention. He exclaims, however, that the sexual abuse many black children face can be a biproduct of the culture itself, which doesn’t always promote ideals of safety and security. This is later coined as the ‘generational curse’ of black communities. Toward the end of the song, Kendrick metaphorically frees himself and everyone affected by this toxicity by employing transparency, pride, and positivity, thus aiming to break the so-called generational curse. This all progresses the theme Kendrick reasserts throughout the project: that he is only human."

Some fans might have heard this song and remembered this line from “Thanksgiving,” from Lamar’s EP:\n\nThe good kid from the mad city\nHolding a cereal box instead of a Glock\n\nThe track was produced by Axel of THC and J.LBS, mixed by Ali and features prominent use of sound-bites from classic cartoons. It features MMG lieutenant Gunplay, who shines brightest on the track.\n\nWatch Kendrick break down his favorite cartoons and cereals with Complex below:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yheoOn-mbZc"

      "plain": "This song kicks off good kid, m.A.A.d city’s back half, depicting the immediate aftermath of K.Dot getting jumped by two guys in hoodies at the end of the previous track, “Poetic Justice.” This sets off the album’s theme of realization, ultimately steeling Kendrick’s resolve to get out of the hood.\n\nObviously, that’s easier said than done, as Kendrick delves into the negative effects of gang-culture and being racially profiled by police, who prove to be no help; K.Dot’s trials in the first two verses are reminiscent of Tre’s in the 1991 film Boyz n the Hood, who was harassed by gangsters for being a good kid and police officers for being black. Kendrick notes that while he did not affiliate with either gang, he was wrongly assumed to be involved in Compton gang culture by both sides and the police alike.\n\nThis is one half of the album’s title tracks, followed by “m.A.A.d city,” which continues this song’s narrative.\n\nAlso, “good kid” is notable for its absence of profanity.  It is one of the only tracks on good kid, m.A.A.d. city with this designation (with the exception of “Real” and “Now or Never” on the deluxe edition of the album).   Kendrick’s deliberate avoidance of profanity in this song subtly further drives home the story of a good kid who is simply guilty by association."

      "plain": "“Freedom” is an anthem dedicated to black women. The song brings Beyoncé’s visual album to an apex with the scene ‘hope’ and features the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner pictured with photos of their deceased sons.\n\nThroughout the song, Beyoncé alludes to herself as a force of nature who can empower other women like herself to break free of the bonds society places on them. She addresses her struggle with infidelity as a black woman, as well as alluding to the history of slavery inflicted upon African-Americans, including current issues and the Black Lives Matter movement. Beyoncé and her writers, musicians, and producers sonically reference the musical memories of all those periods.\n\nBeyoncé is joined by Kendrick Lamar in their first ever collaboration. While Beyoncé focuses on women’s issues, Kendrick continues to touch on institutionalized racism, a major theme of his critically acclaimed 2015 album To Pimp A Butterfly. However, Kendrick also brings women to the forefront, alluding to 2Pac’s “Dear Mama” and “Ride 4 Me” while sending a message of empowerment to his own mother.\n\nIn Kendrick’s verse, he employs a style of writing that counts down from ten to five, before switching to a syllable count to further the countdown. This gives the impression that Kendrick is counting down towards something significant. Within context of the song (and the final bars of the verse), Kendrick is likely counting down to freedom from oppression. Yasiin Bey employs a similar writing style on “Mathematics.”\n\nAlong with issues affecting black women, social equality justice are major motifs of this song.\n\nProducer Just Blaze told the Rap Radar podcast that Beyoncé came to him with the “Let Me Try” sample by Kaleidoscope and an already completed demo."

      "plain": "On “We Cry Together,” Kendrick and Taylour Paige take opposite sides in a couple’s ugly dispute that sees them hurling insults at one another for nearly six minutes. Another interpretation of the song is that Taylour represents the state of hip-hop, hating Kendrick for being absent for the last five years—his previous album, DAMN., was released in April 2017.\n\nThe song opens with a vocal sample from Florence + the Machine’s 2018 song, “June,” before transitioning into a stripped-down piano and drum beat courtesy of The Alchemist. Following the album’s release, fans and media outlets pointed out that the song’s concept shares similarities with Eminem’s May 2000 song, “Kim.”\n\nThis track was also teased on March 5, 2020, in pgLang’s “Visual Mission Statement”:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2C7c0_cnEAs?t=238"

      "plain": "“Momma” tells of the personal growth and self-realisation that Kendrick experienced after having persevered against the internal struggles he described as “Lucy” in the preceding track, “For Sale?” ended with Kendrick’s poem:\n\nThe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went runnin' for answers\nUntil I came home\n\nKendrick’s mention of returning home can be interpreted in many different ways at the same time:\n\n\nKendrick literally returning home to Compton (recall from the outro on GKMC’s “Real” that Kendrick’s momma asked him to come back and tell his story to the kids in Compton).\nKendrick returning to Africa, aka the motherland (he actually went to South Africa in 2014, a trip that inspired much of this album).\nKendrick returning to his former, pre-fame self.\n\n\n\nAlthough it’s never explicitly stated, there are some hints to suggest that “Momma” is in fact referring to Africa as Kendrick is returning “back home” to the “Motherland.“ For example, take note of Kendrick’s conversation with the boy in Verse 3 and the final poem Kendrick recites in “Mortal Man.”\n\nThis song is also reminiscent of 2Pac’s “Dear Mama” from the 1995 album Me Against the World. Funnily enough, the 2 albums were released almost exactly 20 years from each other and both “Dear Mama” and “Momma” come 9th in their respective track lists."

A momentous theme on this project, Lamar goes in depth about his struggles with mental health, opening the song with a short sketch where his partner, Whitney Alford, tells him to seek counseling from Eckhart Tolle. He goes on to cite “daddy issues” as a reason for gang culture among young Black men in the broader community."

      "plain": "This song offers a deeper insight into the previously introduced figure of Lucy (a character representing Lucifer).\n\nAs the song goes on, it is understood that Lucy is short for Lucifer, hence the lines about temptation and signing contracts. The name makes the song work in tandem with “For Free?.” Both songs relate to his value as a musician, and how that transcends in to his value as a person. On “For Free?” he criticizes the culture that breeds a belief that musicians and famous people must “floss” or be showy with their money. Here, he juxtaposes that criticism with the seductive nature of the hip-hop lifestyle, namely the bling culture, and the idea that once an artist signs a deal and receives their advance, all their dreams will come true."

      "plain": "“hey now” is the fifth track on Kendrick Lamar’s sixth studio album, GNX. Surprise-released on November 22, 2024, alongside the rest of the project, the song acts as a sort of falling action following the climactic outro of track four, titled “man at the garden,” leading up to yet another high-point with track six, “reincarnated.”\n\nIt features a guest verse from underground artist and LA native Dody6, who was freed from incarceration on August 17, 2024, after spending seven years in prison. The song serves as a bold declaration to rise above adversity, avoid distractions, and protect one’s vision and purpose while navigating the complexities of life and the music industry."

      "plain": "In “Autumn Leaves,” Chris is clinging to the remnants of his relationship in an attempt to save it. He shows a vulnerable side in the melancholic track, pleading with his lover to stay. In a September 2013 interview with SKEE TV, Chris revealed that Lamar wrote his verse from the “mindset of a critic” who was coaching Chris through the song. in addition, Chris also praised Lamar’s lyricism and ability to paint a picture with his words.\n\n“Autumn Leaves” was never released as a single, but a music video was shot for the track in Hawaii, with Chris' on-off girlfriend Karreuche Tran as the leading lady. This may allude to the fact that the track was written about their relationship.\n\n“Autumn Leaves” marks the second collaboration between Chris and Kenny, following March 2013’s “R.I.P. (Remix)”."

Colorism affects the black community profusely due to its roots, which spawn from the history of slavery in America. In the song, Kendrick details the importance of loving all people no matter how light or dark.\n\n\n\nIn an interview, Kendrick described the song saying:\n\nThe idea was to make a record that reflected all complexions of black women. There’s a separation between the light and the dark skin because it’s just in our nature to do so, but we’re all black. This concept came from South Africa and I saw all these different colors speaking a beautiful language.\n\nIn the same interview, Rapsody said the original idea wasn’t for Kendrick to even have a verse, Kendrick wanted Prince to do the hook and have Rhapsody spit two verses.\n\nAlso note: A Tribe Called Quest, one of the pioneers of jazz rap, referenced the Universal Zulu Nation many times throughout their discography. The Universal Zulu Nation is described as an “organization of individuals in search of success, peace, knowledge, wisdom, understanding and the righteous way of life.”"

The song comes directly after “Savior (Interlude),” which Baby Keem also plays a central role on.\n\nIn the intro, Kendrick sets the tone by reminding those who look up to public figures that they are only human. Each verse tackles a different subject: in the first verse, he addresses a host of racial issues; in the second, he talks about COVID-19 and political correctness; and, in the third verse, he discusses his own flaws and struggles.\n\nKendrick is well-known for his Christian faith, as evidenced by such songs as “YAH.” and “FEAR.” from April 2017’s DAMN.—which dropped on Good Friday, the day Christians commemorate Christ’s crucifixion. With this in mind, when Kendrick talks about the lack of a modern-day Messiah, we are instead pointed to his savior: Jesus Christ."

      "plain": "“untitled 07 | 2014-2016” is a three-part track that captures the arc of an emotional rush: the initial elation, the inflated confidence, and coming down. It also works well with Kendrick’s most prominent lyrical themes: HiiiPower, self-love, his growing influence as a rapper/philanthropist, and sexual gratification.\n\nUnlike every other track on the album, the song does not have a specific date attached to it, likely meaning it was made in piecemeal rather than in one jam session.\n\nSwizz Beatz posted on Instagram that part of this track was produced by his and Alicia Keys‘ 5-year-old son, Egypt Dean. Pictured below is Egypt with Kendrick, Jay Z, Usher and other legends.\n\n\n\nKendrick later released a shortened version of this track as a single titled “untitled 07 | levitate,” which only features Part I."

It’s mainly characterized by a unique piano chord inversion and reverse 808s, which help bring together a pen-focused West Coast cypher between Kendrick and fellow California rappers Peysoh, Hitta J3, and YoungThreat.\n\nThe title’s namesake takes after the 1987 Buick Grand National muscle car, which remains a symbol of Compton culture throughout the album.\n\nKendrick, and presumably all of the track’s features, recorded “gnx” on November 20, 2024—just two days prior to its release—after Kendrick asked Rascal to send an “ignorant West [Coast]” beat for one of GNX’s final studio sessions."

On one side you have Pusha T who’s sold cocaine half his life and on the other you have Kendrick Lamar, the kid who had to watch his father sniff it during the 80’s crack epidemic.\n\nThe song’s title is a pun on nose+nostalgia, and offers a perspective of looking back at a childhood growing up around cocaine. Scent is also the sense most closely linked to memory, and both verse include distinct references to smells."

      "plain": "“Worldwide Steppers” is the third track on Kendrick Lamar’s fifth and final studio album with Top Dawg Entertainment, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers.\n\nThe track features a brief introduction by Kodak Black. The ensuing chorus and verse provide some insight into his relatively seclusive life, one where he has spent nearly 5 years detached from the public. During this time, he has fathered two children, who seem to have grounded him. Other aspects of this track include religion, which Lamar claims lifted him out of “writer’s block” to create this album.\n\nHe also references various sexual encounters he has had with white women, believing his ancestors would shame him for these decisions; They likely condemn these interracial relationships for disregarding the mass incarceration that White America has imposed over black communities. He even reveals that his partner, Whitney Alford, questioned these choices.\n\nLater in Part 2, he regretfully recalls the harm he has indirectly inflicted on his own communities, referencing a food drive TDE held which may have contributed to heart issues among those that attended. In the end, this song functions as a piece of self-criticism that also reflects the shortcomings of society as a whole."

      "plain": "“gloria” is the outro of Kendrick Lamar’s sixth studio album, GNX, which features vocals from his long-time friend and collaborator, SZA. It marks the sixth collaboration between the two.\n\nThe woman Kendrick speaks of serves as a conceit, becoming an extended metaphor for the discussion of his craft. Gloria, which means “glory” in Spanish, becomes a personification of rap glory—his “pen” and the artistic journey it represents. The relationship described symbolizes his intimate and often conflicted bond with his art, reflecting its power to uplift and consume him. In this sense, “gloria” follows in the footsteps of other songs that discuss larger issues in hip hop , such as “I Used to Love H.E.R” by Common and “I Gave You Power” by Nas.\n\nBoth SZA & Kendrick highlight the duality of love—its power to heal and harm."

You looked at me and said, `` Baby, dry your eyes Depend on me as your relief, let your anger be mine '' We was locked in ever since then So territorial, even took me 'way from my friends, hmm, hmm ( Gah, gah, gah ) Said you gon ' see other people if I did n't grow with you Was n't no more holdin ' them pistols in front of stores with you You want reality, not tragedy, for sure, I get you To tell the truth, I been pretty used to what open-minded people do In 2014, I went to Africa, baby, you was my passenger My eyes and ears for all the years the neighborhood had baffled us Of course I had to wrap it up, I did n't fully trust you Fabrication, I disgust you, then you blocked me, I said, ``  you '' , what? I gave you life, I breathe the  ' charisma in this  I bring the blessings, I gave you power , I bring the rainfall, I gave you hustle Then fall right back in love the very moment that I touch you ( Gah, gah, gah ) You were spontaneous, firecracker, plus our love is dangerous Life of passion, laughin ' at you lose your temper, slightly crashin ' Dumb enough to ill reaction, ai n't no disrespect Highly sensitive, possessed, saw potential, even when it 's tragic So jealous, hate it when I hit the club to get some  Wrote 'em off, rather see me hit the church and get religious Who you foolin '?

      "plain": "This untitled song came as a surprise release via Kendrick Lamar’s Instagram on September 11, 2024, at approximately 5 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. The post contained no text or caption. Tentative titles included: “Dear God,” “Watch The Party Die” and “The Day The Party Died.”\n\nThe piece arrived shortly after Kendrick’s announcement that he would be headlining the Halftime Show at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, Louisiana. This is his first musical release since the number one hit single “Not Like Us,” a diss track aimed at Drake.\n\nAdditionally, the track was released at the start of the 2024 VMAs—a seemingly calculated move that underscores Kendrick’s message. Much of the track expresses his frustration with the current state of the music industry and hip-hop culture, specifically critiquing what commercial artists like Drake represent: materialism, hedonism, and the glorification of superficial success. By dropping the track during such a high-profile cultural event, Kendrick shifts attention away from the mainstream celebration of commercial music and forces listeners to engage with the deeper issues plaguing the industry.\n\nThe cover art features a pair of black Nike Air Force 1s, which came from a supposedly random eBay listing:"

      "plain": "The song’s theme is based on common phrases, such as:\n\nThe loudest in the room is the weakest in the room.\n\nor\n\nThose who tell don’t know and those who know don’t tell.\n\nIts title is a reference to the posthumously released 2Pac track, 1997’s “Lie To Kick It”—which also inspired Ice Cube’s “You Ain’t Gotta Lie (Ta Kick It)” in 2000; the latter of which is sampled here for good measure. Other notable interpolations include “Fly Fo Life” by Suga Free and “You’re Getting a Little Too Smart” by Detroit Emeralds.\n\nIt’s a powerful message of the figurative purgatory that rappers and entertainers can enter if they are not stratospherically successful, yet not anonymous enough to return to their hood without receiving unwanted attention. There are racial undertones here, and the use of stereotypical black imagery paints Kendrick as a hood figure; but it can be applied to other aspects in life, where you feel pressure to perform or act a certain way.\n\nKendrick’s rational side is warning the listener not to lie for respect or personal gain. This furthers the album’s message, as portrayed in tracks like “For Sale? (Interlude)” and “For Free? (Interlude),” where he criticizes those who think rap is inherently about money and power."

However the majority (the white man) takes “a piece” of Kendrick—to devaluate and capitalize off his talents. Likewise “a piece of mines” talks about the “white man” taking a piece of you to become a famous artist.\n\nThe original version was performed along with  Thundercat, Bilal, Terrace Martin, and Anna Wise on one of the final episodes of The Colbert Report in December 2014. According to Martin, the song was written the day before the performance as Kendrick didn’t want to play his then-latest single, “i.”\n\nThough Martin claimed there were no plans to release a studio version, one was released as “untitled 03 | 05.28.2013.” on untitled unmastered., a collection of untitled tracks, several of which were also performed on late night talk shows.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kendricklamar/status/706270048143306753"

      "plain": "This is the sixth installment in Kendrick Lamar’s ongoing ‘The Heart’ series. A staple of his career, each entry finds Kendrick waxing poetic about the state of his life at the time of its recording; usually in the lead-up to an album release.\n\nToward the end of Kendrick’s public beef with Drake earlier in 2024, Drake released “THE HEART PART SIX,” mocking Lamar’s series after Kendrick mocked Drake’s own timestamp series with “6:16 In LA.” Shortly thereafter, Drake would delete his Instagram post promoting this song. Along with the tone of the piece itself, many interpreted this move as Drake silently accepting defeat.\n\n\n\nThis track is Kendrick’s attempt at reclaiming his series. The formatting of “The Heart” series has always been “The Heart Pt. __” while this track dropped the word “The” and has been stylized all in lowercase letters, this might’ve been done to avoid any confusion with Drake’s version.\n\nAlthough some might expect Kendrick to address the rap battle on this track, he does not make any reference to the beef and commits to his original idea for the series: expressing his thoughts on the culture at large as well as his personal life. In this case, he focuses on his early years in the industry and his eventual departure from Top Dawg Entertainment and Black Hippy."

NOTICE that this affliction isn’t a vice, or “evil” like in “Tammy’s Song (Her Evils)”—this is true pain from having to survive.\n\nHe is indeed telling her not to become a prostitute through vivid imagery, but it is in an effort to help develop her understanding of why women do such things. He is NOT demonizing prostitutes; he is merely pointing out that it is a profession that damages people. He wants his sister to see the woman behind every whore.\n\n\n\nThis track is recalled in Kendrick’s opus that followed Section.80—GKMC. In verse 2 of “Sing About Me,” he takes on the perspective of Keisha’s sister who admonishes him:\n\nHow could you ever just put her on blast and shit Judging her past and shit–well it’s completely my future…\nA nigga behind me right now, askin' for ass and shit…\n\nTDE President, Punch, explained in an interview with Complex that this song was originally for GKMC:\n\nEven ‘Keisha (sic) Song’ was initially for good kid, m.A.A.d. city, but it was from a different point of view."

It’s super dope and inspirational.” I was like, whoa, this is the best rapper in the globe – he fucks with my music! That’s one of the things that made me want to keep working on my music and try to keep it going ‘cause I’m not the most rappity rap ass nigga. That’s not me but I really love Kendrick’s music.\n\nAdditionally, Kendrick’s verse on this song was previewed during his explosive performance at the 2018 Grammy Awards, before the song and official soundtrack.\n\nThis is something Kendrick seems to enjoy doing. In fact, two songs from 2016’s untitled.unmastered had similar rollouts with ​\"untitled 03 | 05.28.2013.\" being performed on the Colbert Report’s final show, and ​\"untitled 05 | 09.21.2014.\" being performed at the 2016 Grammys."

Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God Now I 'm thinkin ' to myself, hollow tips is all I got Now I 'm drinkin ' by myself, at the intersection, parked Watch you when you walk inside your house You threw your briefcase all on the couch I plan on creeping through your  ' door and blowin ' out Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, I 'm gone He drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin ' the handle Lit off Henny, I 'm tryna dismantle These wicked ways, I 've engaged in such a gamble 'Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait That 's a bit ambitious maybe I 'm trippin ' Maybe I 'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance It 's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall Studied the son of God and still do n't recognize my flaws I guess I 'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful I pray my experience helps you As for me I 'm tryna sort it out Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul But who knows? I just need a little space to breathe I know perception is key, so I am king The other side has never mortified my mortal mind The borderline between insanity is Father Time I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I 'm blind I know that I 'm intelligent, my confidence just died Carpe diem, seize the day, I ca n't compromise A tapeworm could n't cure this gluttonous appetite A couple trinkets, they seein ' me as I pacify But could n't fathom the meaning of seein ' sacrifice I 'm passin ' lives on the daily, maybe I 'm losing faith Genocism and capitalism just made me hate Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date Professional dream killers reason why I 'm awake I 'm sleepwalkin ', I 'm street stalkin ', I 'm outta place Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes Before I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates? Or this is just a mirage or a facade Wait",

This was Lamar’s highest-profile collaboration at the time, but he has also featured on other songs including most recently “I Love Music” with Tech N9ne.\n\nGame states that this song allowed him to show listeners how he “judges himself” and also as a sort of sum up of his previous albums."

      "plain": "As a closing track for the album, Kendrick teams up with the executive producer and West coast legend Dr. Dre.\n\nOther than “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe”, this is the only track from present-day Kendrick’s perspective. In an interview with Google Play, Kendrick spoke on the song:\n\nI wrote the lyrics the day I met Dre. I easily got inspired, I just started writing. And that was actually the first studio session I had with Dre. That’s the last song on the album for a specific reason. That’s the first song I did with Dre, that was the start of my new life.\n\nThe song acts as an epilogue to the story, in which Kendrick is looking retrospectively upon the events of the narrative/his own life experiences and conveying how he’s turned himself away from a potential life of crime, alcoholism, violence etc. instead becoming someone he’s more proud of and someone who can try to tell the younger generations living in similar situations that they can turn their lives around too. The album then comes full circle by including the lines that precede the albums first track."

      "plain": "In this opening song, Kendrick launches right into the story of Keisha and Tammy in the loose concept album Section.80. He uses these two characters to explore issues facing those born in the 1980s, touching on topics such as the Ronald Reagan government, sexuality, and drugs. “Fuck Your Ethnicity” is his exploration of racial issues. Kendrick has said that he notices his fans are of all races and backgrounds. He welcomes anyone that can relate to him and understand his story, regardless of color. He is trying to do away with race as a common division between people.\n\nNote that the album title is a play on the public housing program known as Section 8. In 1982, Ronald Reagan cut funding to the Section 8 program in half. He spent the next few years fighting against any government assistance for housing for the poor. Critics and historians argue that one of Reagan’s biggest legacies was to increase the divide between the rich and poor in America."

      "plain": "The title “man at the garden” seems to refer to the story of a man who is listing the things he did to deserve to enter the “garden,” symbolizing biblical paradise. Kendrick repeats the phrase “I deserve it all” throughout the track to accredit the things he’s done to reach the garden.\n\nThis song is a manifesto of Kendrick’s life philosophy: he deserves everything he’s earned because of the sacrifices he’s made, the principles he’s upheld, and the struggles he’s overcome. It’s also a challenge for listeners to reflect on their own lives and consider what they’ve done to claim their success or “deserve it all.”\n\nKendrick also pays homage to Nas with this track (previously commended in “wacced out murals”) as the production, rapping cadence, and themes match that of “One Mic,” a song which came at the height of Nas' beef with JAY-Z. In referencing “One Mic,” Kendrick parallels Jay and Nas' rivalry with his and Drake’s."

      "plain": "“The Spiteful Chant” was originally the ninth track on Kendrick Lamar’s first full-length project, Section.80. It was produced by Sounwave and Dave Free, and contains a sample from “Iron” by Woodkid:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkb0kDacjs\n\nThe downtempo anthem touches on various themes, including patience, perseverance, dealing with two-faced people, and overcoming adversity. In August 2019, Genius reported on the song’s removal from streaming services, likely due to sample clearance issues."

      "plain": "“dodger blue” is the eighth track on Kendrick Lamar’s November 2024 album, GNX. It features Wallie The Sensei, Roddy Ricch, and Siete on the chorus, with additional contributions from Ink and Sam Dew.\n\nThe song is a vibrant ode to LA culture, highlighting neighborhoods like Gardena and Compton while critiquing outsiders' superficial perceptions of the city. Lamar delivers sharp, assertive verses, reflecting his experiences and resilience growing up in the streets of Los Angeles. Wallie The Sensei and Roddy Ricch enhance the track’s West Coast vibe with a chorus emphasizing ambition and loyalty.\n\nLater in the track, Lamar’s playful yet commanding tone emerges in his collaboration with Ink, introducing lines like “Walk, walk, walk.” The outro, featuring Sam Dew, provides a haunting conclusion, tying together the themes of pride, survival, and identity that resonate throughout the song.\n\nThe song and album also arrive shortly after the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the New York Yankees to win the 2024 World Series; their eighth championship in franchise history. Lamar is famously a fan of the team."

      "plain": "“Mirror” is the outro to Kendrick Lamar’s fifth studio album, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers. He discusses the pressures of fame and the dichotomy of living selfishly despite his modest image.\n\nThe song’s production sees a heavy Funk and Neo Soul influence due to the bounciness of the beat. The heavy drums in the background of the track give the song an 80s skate-like vibe, forcing Kendrick’s cadence to follow its pattern.\n\nIn the song, Kendrick articulately sums up the majority of the themes of the album. “Mirror” serves as a metaphor for one’s own personal growth, suggesting to Kendrick fans that despite his long wait to release music, they shouldn’t wait on him and should grow on their own.\n\nKendrick makes it clear that due to his newborn daughter, his oldest child, and his wife, he will always put himself first—except for his family—as he can’t sacrifice the little time he has with his family for anyone.\n\nWhat may seem to be a more basic album outro in comparison to DAMN.’s outro, “DUCKWORTH.,” the song’s deeper meaning reflects on his wait to release music, exhibiting his growth for his fans. Kendrick speaks deeply about the pressure he feels in order to take care of his family in the best way, subsequently, taking time off to find himself."

      "plain": "On “Pray,” Kendrick Lamar reflects over “the voices of art” and personifies a song by Michael Jackson and a speech by Martin Luther King, Jr., respectively. In each of the first two verses, Lamar mentions two dates that relate to the lives of each man—The Jackson 5’s “ABC” released on February 24, 1970, and MLK delivered his “I Have A Dream” speech on August 28, 1963.\n\nKendrick uses every verse to explore how the media is quick to dismiss an artist’s contributions to society due to their personal shortcomings—he specifically delves into Jackson’s pedophilia accusations and King’s marital infidelity. In the final verse, Kendrick establishes that artists bring meaning to the world regardless of their individual imperfections.\n\nThe song was recorded sometime in 2019. Leaked on August 18th, 2020, under the name “Prayer”, however it was only ever titled “Pray” and “Mr. Morale”. Ultimately scrapped due to being leaked along with “Gotta Love Me” and “Somebody.”. Also mistakenly thought to be an original version of “The Heart Part 5”.\n\nLyrics for the song were present on Tidal for “Mr. Morale” when the song first released before being changed. Zaytop claimed that this was meant to show up on the album as the title track but it was replaced with the version produced by Pharrell Williams."

Designed to make you think Races and faces embracin ' my conscience in letter form How gracious was I speakin ' on changes once outside the norm? The person responsible, my creator He never conformed or used hatred to form mass retaliation Watch him perform with conviction Two hundred and fifty thousand souls left they homes to listen I gather his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission His life became heroic, then tables turned My creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned Other women, infidelity stricken, I ca n't say he was perfect It made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me I prayed that I survived in the midst of the controversy How many lives will fall on deaf ears if I 'm not worthy? I wo n't justify his personal problems, that 's not my job I was only born to make sure your children can play outside And I imagine the other demons, he hid before he died If they came to surface, this dream probably wo n't be alive because of you I was born in paranoia, it 's poison for us We ca n't create with joyous ambition, we 're out of luck The critics formed a new coalition and huddled up The non-creators are now elated and out of touch Why ca n't you gladly appreciate the influence we give? Stop starin ' at me disgusted, my substance made sure you 'd lived You want the head of the messenger and the history from him Which eventually takes away from the good you accustom Think of a life without the likes of imagination that 's prosperin ' The bodies that you consider genius, you like to box 'em in The great debaters and thinkers, they gave you a voice Why ca n't you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ? Because your better judgement will always look down on me But if I recollect how we connect, you 'll account on me I got a theory that most of y'all wo n't allow to see It goes like this, talent does n't choose morality See, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart?

Cardo and Yung Exclusive (aka Yex) produced the song.\n\nThe title of the song refers to Los Angeles (Vice City). A vice is a behavior that is considered immoral or sinful. Each artist touches on their personal vices, but the overarching theme is the social commentary of black culture. As depicted in the video, the vices appear to be money and women—stereotypical vices that are often glamorized in the media.\n\nThis is the music video version which has a longer verse from ScHoolboy Q, but ends after that instead of after Kendrick Lamar."

When two  making it out had never sounded logical? Three  making it out? That 's mission impossible So I never believed the type of performance that I could do I was n't jealous cause of the talents they got I was terrified they 'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton Thank God ( Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly )",

      "plain": "This is the first song from Kendrick Lamar’s official mixtape, sometimes stylized as O(verly) D(edicated), where he raps over an extended version of The Roots' 2010 instrumental “A Peace of Light.” Kendrick has previously stated that this is his favorite song on the tracklist. According to a 2011 SoulCulture interview at SXSW, it features one of his favorite original verses.\n\nHe adopts a stream-of-consciousness flow, expressing his thoughts as they come to him in the studio. The song is also the sequel to April 2010’s “The Heart Pt. 1” and was followed by 2012’s “The Heart Pt. 3 (Will You Let it Die?)”, 2017’s “The Heart Pt. 4”, 2022’s “The Heart Part 5” and 2024’s “heart pt. 6.”\n\nIn a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone, he explained what led to this song:\n\nI remember saying to myself, ‘I just wanna show a spew of emotion on a record. I don’t care how long the bars are, but people are literally gonna have to feel me.’ I told myself that if I can’t connect that way, then it ain’t no point in me just putting a bunch of good words together. So that spaz-out toward the end, where I just choke up and lose my breath – I wanna keep all that."

Kendrick received two Grammys for this version of the song at the 57th Grammy Awards for Best Rap Song and for Best Rap Performance.\n\nThe up-tempo track once again delves deep into Kendrick’s personal perspective on the world. While premiering the track on LA’s Power 106, Kendrick explained the song is about self expression, inspired by the lack of self love on the streets of Compton.\n\nThe track further explores subjects he already covered — and personally explained on Genius — in his song “Real” from good kid, m.A.A.d city:\n\nhttp://rap.genius.com/2339642\n\nAlso, check out our breakdowns of the:\n\n\nAlbum Version\nSNL Version\nProduction\nCover Art\nLyric Video\nMusic Video\nMerchandise"

      "plain": "“Purple Hearts” is the final track on the first disc and the ninth track overall from Kendrick Lamar’s fifth and final studio album with Top Dawg Entertainment, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers.\n\nThe title alludes to the Purple Heart, a military decoration awarded by the US armed forces to those who are wounded, injured, or killed in battle.\n\nThe instrumental employs heavy drums and synth elements which serve as a lush foundation back-dropping lyrics about love, spirituality, and drugs: the title may also be a subtle allusion to lean, otherwise known as “purple drank” or liquid codeine. It can also point to purple marks or bruises, which are often left on the skin as a consequence of an injury in a fight or an accident. In the album’s context, this could represent a couple’s attempt to heal after the toxic fight depicted on the previous track, “We Cry Together.”"

Kendrick could be comparing his station in the rap game to the fictional horror of being surrounded by villains or monsters, similar to the iconic series."

      "plain": "The title, “Poe Man’s Dreams,” is a play on the southern pronunciation of ‘poor,’ but also alludes to the classic American writer Edgar Allan Poe. Poe’s cause of death in 1849 was inconclusive, but many historians suspect he died of symptoms related to alcohol poisoning. In this sense, he gave in to his vice, which led to his early demise.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe was famous for moving away from romanticism in his work. Instead, he constructed concepts based on realistic or sometimes horrific situations that many literary analysts believe reflected his life. Kendrick Lamar and GLC do the same thing here, rapping about real-life situations.\n\nKendrick touches on such themes as giving in to peer pressure or bad habits. This track also sounds similar to Kanye West’s February 2004 track, “Spaceship,” which appears on his first album, The College Dropout—another song which features GLC."

The song was in the studio and it was just an unfinished song. I was trying to figure out what I was gonna do with it—he just went to the studio and took it! Then it came back and he had a hook on it, a bridge, a 24, and then I reached out to Earl and Ab, you know what I’m saying, and we threw their verses on there. It’s really his song!\n\nThe song originally premiered at a Danny Brown concert on September 18, 2016 before being aired on Hot 97 just days later."

This is one of the most talked about songs from “Control System,” mainly because of the oft-misinterpreted lines about Jay-Z. You’ll notice it’s peppered with references to him, and speaking of this with Complex Magazine Soulo said:\n\n\nMy favorite rapper of all time is Jay-Z hands down. For sure, I probably have been the most inspired by him lyrically. It doesn’t feel like it’s jocking or biting [when I quote Jay-Z in my rhymes]. It’s not. Being a fan of hip-hop, just what I’ve seen done time and time again.\n\nI’m 25 now man, I try to remember that. I’m 25 now. I see myself with those guys, so I just want everybody to know that that’s how I feel. When you speak of me I want you to speak of me amongst them. That’s the only statement that I’m trying to make. But at the same time you incorporate the lyrics.\n\nEverybody is talking about my Jay-Z line off ‘Illuminate’ but, the majority of the song was inspired by Jay-Z. If you’re a big fan of Jay-Z you can hear it. That’s what it was about. And I hope Jay gets a chance to hear it. If he is who I think he is, then he should understand exactly what I intended to do with that. I was paying homage but letting him know, we coming. You got some new young cats on your heels now. That’s all…\n\n\nWatch Soul decode this with Jay-Z’s Life+Times below:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-n9bPiIBwI\n\nThe sample used here is an unusual one, specifically of Madonna’s “Live to Tell”.\n\nA music video, directed by Fredo Tovar and Scott Fleishman, was released on January 15, 2013 and can be found below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DszIoEP8OAo"

It is told from both the man and the woman’s perspective.\n\nThe song contains a sample of “Go Stetsa,” a 1986 track by Stetsasonic. Kendrick would use this sample again on his next project, 2011’s Section.80, on the track “Poe Man’s Dreams.”\n\nIt also features a clip from “She Says She Loves Me” by Lamont Carey, during the outro. The poem is about marital abuse, which ties into the last lines of the second verse.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toceWMAZNNg"

And I vow on the tape that I 'll never break You can break bread with me now We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue And walked that mile In the darkness I often sit back And get lost in the rap that I wrote When you told me that it spoke to your soul I was talking to you I was walking it through every ghetto Tell success hello We here",

      "plain": "This song is a warning to humanity. Kendrick highlights the destructive nature of mankind, warning us that if we continue to sin, Revelations, specifically Judgement Day (the apocalypse), will be upon us soon.\n\nThis first track on untitled unmastered. directly connects to the final song “Mortal Man” on his previous album To Pimp A Butterfly. “Mortal Man” features a posthumous interview with Tupac wherein Kendrick asks Pac to explain the metaphor of “the ground”, to which he replies:\n\n2pac: The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil. That’s how I see it, my word is bond. I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people; the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people.\n\nThis entire song is a vivid dramatization of  2Pac’s Marxist metaphor, depicting the ground cracking open and swallowing the rich sinners above, in a graphic biblical style. Kendrick attempts to prove all the love and dedication he’s demonstrated towards God, despite gaining wealth and power.  The track is Kendrick’s plea of repentance, so he may be spared from this terrifying fate.\n\nKendrick has been signalling the end of times since a 2012 collaboration with Big Sean on “100”. More recently, in an interview with Billboard, Kendrick also shared that he believes that the Biblical “Last Days” are near, this belief of Kendrick’s is clearly noticeable in this song."

      "plain": "Kendrick doesn’t think girls need make-up to look sexy – just a brain…\nThe first of three songs dedicated to a prostitute named Keisha that Kendrick sympathizes with. Followed by “Keisha’s Song” and verse two of “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reliance on makeup shown also serves as a parallel to other substances that are constantly abused like alcohol and drugs. The makeup represents how people cover themselves up instead of facing the real world similarly to how people will attempt to drink away their pain instead of facing things head on. Kendrick shows this through the bridge:\n\nLadies and gentlemen\nAnd you ain’t gotta get drunk to have fun\nYou ain’t gotta get drunk to have fun\nYou ain’t gotta get drunk to have fun"

      "plain": "This song describes the unforeseen difficulties that come with the rap game and gangbanging, comparing it to ocean depths. Some adapt and eventually make it their territory, while some end up drowning like Anderson .Paak’s character.\n\nProducer Focus… spoke about the track’s production:\n\n\nI had a music bed that I was building, that’s the initial thing you hear at the top end. It’s just a little sound I put together and treated. I played it for Ty and I told him where I wanted it to go, but I know I can’t do the trap drums or that aggressive trap sound, so he told me to get up with Cardiak. He came in did the drum bed, I grabbed the sessions from Cardiak, married the two, and starting doing certain little tweaks like glitching. Dahi and Dem Jointz came in and added to what we had there and Dre came in over all of that and just orchestrated where he wanted what piece and how he wanted it to sound. It literally happened in a matter of hours.\n\nFor Dre to see us working together, no egos no publishing splits. Nobody was tripping over that. We weren’t there as individuals, we were there as a team and lead by the coach. For us to make the sound that he wanted, that was the triumph, that was the victory."

      "plain": "In “Crown,” the Compton native Kendrick Lamar gives us insight into his psyche, portraying his deeply conflicted inner-self while performing over a prominent sample from the 2016 song “Through the Night,” by Duval Timothy.\n\nWhile rapping about his contrasting feelings about being seen and doing his best as a leader in his community while – obviously – not being able to please everyone, Kendrick also speaks about love – for his family, his fans and for himself – and makes references to William Shakespeare’s Henry IV throughout the song’s melodic refrain.\n\nThe song’s rhythm scheme might also channel Shakespeare’s metric, as it’s comparable to the poet’s famous Iambic pentameter, which was notably incorporated within his best known play, Romeo and Juliet, and often used by several English authors to introduce situations regarding love and affection between their characters.\n\nIt’s also worth-noting that the crown imagery is further displayed on the album’s cover art, where Kendrick – a Christian himself – wears a crown of thorns, one of the key symbols of the passion and crucifixion of Jesus Christ."

      "plain": "Ab-Soul is given the majority of the song to clarify the subjects and themes discussed by Kendrick Lamar throughout the album (Keisha, Tammy, ‘80s babies of the Ronald Reagan Era, living well etc) and adds some input of his own.\n\nKendrick Lamar uses this outro produced by Terrace Martin to simply state that all of what he said throughout this album is just his opinion. Maybe you do or don’t believe his morals and beliefs, but at least you heard his beliefs and felt the message he was trying to share with the rest of the world. He feels it is more important for you to simply listen and form opinions of your own rather than listen to him and conform to his beliefs. We are all just humans trying to find our form of the real truth in this society that tries to suppress us.\n\nKendrick Lamar says that he finds the truth through the music he writes, composes and raps."

      "plain": "“Kush & Corinthians” deals with the struggle between moral/just actions and the temptations of earthly vices. It is important to note that Paul’s letters to the Corinthians have a lot to do with social justice and morality. In the second letter to the Corinthians, Paul deals with accusations made against him by others in the early Christian church. You can probably start to see the parallels between his letters and this song.\n\n\n\nThis track also had a followup in BJ The Chicago Kid’s debut studio album Pineapple Now-Laters."

      "plain": "Kendrick kicks off the Black Panther soundtrack with a solitary verse speaking from the perspective of T'Challa, the main character, and alter ego of Black Panther. This is a full contrast to Kendrick’s second verse on “King’s Dead,” (appears later on the album) which speaks from the perspective of Erik Killmonger, who is Black Panther’s rival and is learned to be T'Challa’s cousin. The song also parallels Kendrick’s own perspective and responsibilities in society.\n\nThe song bears a calm, peaceful, hopeful, and uplifting vibe from the instrumentation throughout the song, down to Kendrick’s verse. This is to exemplify the heroic nature exhibited by T’Challa. Throughout the song, the beat switches to a darker key-laden sound, which expresses T'Challa’s Black Panther side. On the other hand, Kendrick’s portrayal of antagonist, Erik Killmonger in “King’s Dead,” is rapped in an aggressive and violent manner, while the beat is more dark and grim."

'' Holler back at me,  And if they said that I 'm the one, why you asking me, ? 'Cause when the whole world see you as 'Pac reincarnated Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David And pray to God that you make it or live your life in The Matrix 'Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it 's quite contagious I need to separate myself to stand out, huh I need a better way to take your fans now, huh I need to kill you  dead Three hollow-tips aimed at your head I 'll be damned if the chopper jam now And we never ask for no handouts I 'll take you back to that pack of Black & Milds in my hand now ( Soul! ) In the midst of it all, was cooking—them pots and pans out Looking forward as four was forced to form a new clan now Fast-forward as I wait in line for this passport The homies was still poor, with work in a Jansport ( Ugh ) Whoever thought that Rosenberg would mention me to Dre? Even Vanessa from XXL had told him press play And there goes my fate, now I 'm on the stage with Snoop Gave me the torch and I ran with it in hot pursuit Rapped with my forefathers—even wreck it with Gaga, too Lyricist of the year—fuck am I 'posed to do? Rock! Cool, 'cause  wo n't outdo us in the booth Even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof I came, I saw, I conquered No shame, I blame all of this on Compton Thinking 'bout when Sherane tried to set me up Cold game, full circle—they set up her I put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs The fight to ignite any wrong and right that I prolong The story, the short film ; the glory of Him and them The worry of mothers that do n't recover when babies killed The trial and the tribulations, the newer Miseducation The view of a body wasted, you knew somebody ai n't make it The angry, the adolescent ; the reason I ask this question : Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?

      "plain": "“Growing Apart (To Get Closer)” is the second track on Kendrick Lamar’s first full-length mixtape, Overly Dedicated. It samples an obscure 1970s funk record by Bobby Cook & The Explosions titled “On The Way.” It also interpolates 1978’s “Hangin'” by little known Australian R&B group Stylus.\n\nThe track was produced by Tae Beast and features vocals from Jhené Aiko, who also released her own version in 2011, titled “Growing Apart Too.” The remix is the last track on Aiko’s Sailing Soul(s) project, with Lamar’s fourth verse now placed at the beginning of the song. It appropriately closes out the mixtape, beginning with the line:\n\nSo in conclusion…\n\nKendrick’s version fits with the themes of other songs on Overly Dedicated, such as “Opposites Attract (Tomorrow W/O Her)” and “Cut You Off (To Grow Closer),” which is the second to last track on the album—giving the project some chiastic structure."

We should be slowing down Where are you going? We should be growing now That 's what she said to me, that place I used to call home is just a bed to me And we do n't even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep Meanwhile I 'm in these streets with everybody, I 'm trying to get it And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness Look each other in the face and barely blink I tried to make it right, but the pen ran out of ink So if my letters do n't reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync That 's what it said to me But the place I call ambition now dead to me Gone and forgotten, I 'm off track like Dale Earnhardt My liver rotten, alcoholic tripping  bad  and they got bad intentions Club night, guys and dolls Balling out, but I 'm 'bout to drop the ball I 'm calling out for help, my engineer called Told me come to the studio, I wan na tell him, `` Nah '' That 's what he said to me But that place we call Heaven unfair to me, only 144 can go Seven billion people on planet Earth today Is it something that I do n't know? I know to follow Him rather following people Or follow vanity 'cause that means I 'm following evil Guess I 'm following evil, I should follow cathedral Blessings I need, but live like I do n't need you So in conclusion, we all seem to stumble, planning our own demise Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size So to what is important in my life, I apologize I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified We all get distracted, the question is Would you bounce back or bounce backwards? Would you not know how to act or take action? It 's just a part of life and if your vision ’ s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight",

League talked about the track:\n\n\nThat was an old beat—I’m talking about when me and the guys first got together. And that sample came off of vinyl. It was Pointer Sisters. Isaac Hayes wrote it. How I chopped it—man, sometimes when you chop shit you just be in the zone. I remember saying, ‘Yo, I want all live claps.’ So we recorded a bunch of claps and live percussion. We added bass and added strings and all that.\n\nSo when it’s time to get on the album, we had to take the sample out. They didn’t want us to re-imagine it; they wanted it to sound exactly like the sample. So we had to replay the original sample to a tee. And we had to make it sound like it was off our shitty vinyl player. So when you hear the song, that is not a sample.\n\n\nThe beat samples “Easy Days” as performed by The Pointer Sisters.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbrYWAST67c\n\nThe track was featured on the Grand Theft Auto V radio station, Radio Los Santos."

      "plain": "This song advocates free thinking. SZA preaches, while Kendrick whispers a monologue that represents the struggle of balancing new found fame with his past life. The structure is similar to Eminem’s “Public Service Announcement 2000” on The Marshall Mathers LP.\n\nThe song has elements that give off the ASMR effect, such as Kendrick’s whispering, a soft guitar and clicking which gives this track a brain massage feel.\n\nIn an interview with Complex, frequent collaborator Terrace Martin talked about the song:\n\nThat was done around the same week we did “For Free?” I don’t know why that didn’t make it onto the original album. My only memory of that song is that we were eating heavy ramen, drinking organic vodka and 60-year-old cognac. We were on our low-key, dim candles-type shit.\n\nLines in this song are later mentioned on “untitled 07 2014-2016.”"

The song was debuted on Beats 1 Radio with Zane Lowe.\n\nOn August 6, 2019, SiR first teased the collaboration via Instagram and Twitter. The posts came hours after he announced a new deal with RCA Records; a similar deal to that of SZA prior to the June 2017 release of Ctrl.\n\nSiR typically wears his dreadlocks back and doesn’t variate his style very much. Kendrick, on the other hand, alternates between a variety of looks but has adopted the “hair down” look since the release of his 2017 album DAMN."

      "plain": "The two-parter, “Darkside/Gone,” deals with Dre and company’s mindset both before and after their success. In “Darkside,” Mez admits to being integrated into the gangsta lifestyle while not being a gangsta himself, but also questioning the deeper involvement of his friends. In comparison, Dre embraces that mentality due to his longevity in the game.\n\nIn “Gone,” Dre shifts that energy to defend his fortune and fame as people are lead to believe they’ve “lost him.” He claims he has always been that way, while Kendrick Lamar, relatively new to his success, makes it obvious he intends to keep himself up despite all the controversies he may have caused."

I 'm  with Ice now I 'm  with  that you only can get On an oversea flight now You scared of my heights now But still, I got enemies giving me energy I wan na fight now Subliminal, sending me all of this hate I thought I was holding the mic down I thought I was holding my city up I thought I was good in the media You think I 'm too hood in my video? But really, no clue, you idiot I just ca n't help myself Even when that record spin Every now and then, you hang yourself 'Cause I got the green and gold ( With a million sold ) Plus plenty more, ( and my dollar thicker ) But with or without the diamonds, though ( To you ) I 'm just another ( ! )",

You be tripping sometimes, you have something going on. Like today I woke up and there was stuff that I wanted to go on that didn’t go on right.

The two artists reminisce over their younger days within the confusion of living in the streets, and how they’d find themselves caught in their “temptations” of pursuing good-looking women—or, at least that was their plan for this song anyway; the song has yet to see an official release.\n\nThe audio itself for the song is practically one big snippet."

      "plain": "“Michael Jordan” is the seventh track on the Overly Dedicated mixtape. It was released as a single on September 14, 2010, seven days before the project dropped on September 23. This date coincides with the “two-three” wordplay found in the chorus, which refers to Michael Jordan’s famous jersey number.\n\n\n\nTop Dawg Entertainment eventually released a music video for the song. This was the first significant step toward mainstream exposure since Kendrick’s previous project, 2009’s The Kendrick Lamar EP. It’s likely that he decided to publicize encouraging remarks made by Lil Wayne following the promotion of Jay Rock’s 2008 single “All My Life (In the Ghetto)”—the original version featured a young K. Dot, and he also appeared in the music video, although his verse was absent."

It shows how brutal Compton can be, since the murder rate there is pretty high.\n\nFeatured artist Candice Pillay described what recording the song was like to MTV:\n\n\n‘Genocide’ is the bomb, man. It was produced by Dem Jointz. The way that record started was Marsha Ambrosius — who’s an amazing writer — came up with the hook. There was that little section on there that had the rap-sing part, which is my verse.\n\nJointz played me that record. I was like, ‘Damn, that sh-t is crazy.’ I was like, ‘What are y’all doing with that verse?’ They were looking for someone to sing kind of like a reggae rap. I was like, ‘Let me at it. That’s my shit. I could do that.’"

'' He said to live the way He did, that 's all he want from me Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday I said `` alright, '' enthused that my Lord gave a listen I opened my Bible, in search to be a better Christian And this from a person that never believed in religion But , my life is so  up, man – I ca n't help but give in I 'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed Felt like I 'm free from all my sins when the service was over Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered Then lost my faith again Single black parent from Compton, raising children of four That 's four innocent bastards, 'cause papa they do n't know Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters Ca n't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister Her baby daddy ai n't 'bout , that  ai n't 'bout  Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit She pray to God every night, hoping that he 'll mature And maybe one day his kids something that he 'll live for Baby wan na go back to school, but she need some help Because it 's hard trying to pay the bills when you 're by yourself She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice That said, `` The Devil is a lie, make a better choice '' And so it 's back to McDonald 's and every month dealing With those crazy  people at the county building Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8 Then lost her faith again This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard Your mind 's slipping, wondering, `` Is there really a God? '' Knowing you should n't think that way and trying to freeze your brain But whenever there 's pain, that feeling forever remains We ca n't believe what we ca n't see and reality seems stronger than prayer 'Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair And your son was born with cancer and he live in Urgent Care At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares Searching for answers, that 's human nature, you ai n't in the wrong Just know when you feeling that way, His Spirit 's in the room I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost And wonder why I ai n't ever caught that feeling before Maybe they know Him better, or I do n't know no better But what I do know, is that He 's real and He lives forever So the next time you feel like your world 's about to end I hope you studied, because He 's testing your faith again I 'd rather not live like there is n't a God Than die and find out there really is Think about it",

He says that all people are good people, but the Compton environment of gang violence, police brutality, drugs, and women force kids into this survival mode and turn them into these gangsters. Also the fact that his father was around, helped guide him to make better decisions; according to Kendrick most of his friends didn’t have fathers and if they did they weren’t active in their lives.

'' Westside, that 's a Piru gang, to be exact Well aware they had blue across they hat Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac Shots rang out, hoping to God I was n't wet Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage Never seen that many guns in my life I was paranoid, like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in Somebody said, `` Fall back, we gon ' make these  suffer You my brother like a frat, and that 's just to remind you '' Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, , but This is why they  with me ( I told you,  ) This is why they  with me ( You fake  ) I 'm no gangster, no killer, I 'm just your average Joe ( You fake ) But one thing you should consider, I 'm the realest you know I do n't do black music, I do n't do white music I do everyday life music Give 'em cuts like a  pierced a knife through it You say you through, but I 've been through it – now that 's cold And this is for my county building children In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering I use perseverance in this mad city Where the  drink Remy and hold semi 's for cutthroats Bernie Mac died, it 's no joke Do n't ask why if you do n't know about these killers and thieves Seven grams of weed – you smoke that, but I 'm high off life I could fall out the sky like twice And land in the land of the AKs And the minivans where the fan never on 'Cause it 's hotter than a lunatic 's underarms, in a straight jacket In other words, we get it cracking But I keep it cool, you know? This is why they  with me ( Haha ) This is why they  with me ( Real talk ) I 'm no gangster, no killer, I 'm just your average Joe ( Come on ) But one thing you should consider, I 'm the realest you know So there you have it But I'ma leave you with this An O.G. once told me '' A real gangster is either dead or in jail Or behind the scenes getting real money '' I 'm gone",

      "plain": "This is an updated version of “P&P,” from the 2009 Kendrick Lamar EP.\n\nThe song is similar to the original, but contains minor variations. Part one is nearly identical, with a sample of The Roots‘ 2006 track “Clock with No Hands,” but after the second chorus the beat changes. Also, Ab-Soul begins with the same three lines from before, but the rest of his featured verse is different.\n\nThe track also contains samples of 2003’s “Vibrate” by OutKast, 1981’s “Give It to Me Baby” by Rick James, and 2000’s “I Just Wanna Love U (Give it 2 Me)” by JAY-Z; as well as a snippet from Martin Lawrence’s eponymous 1990s TV show."

      "plain": "As the first official single from Oxnard, “Tints” marks the third collaboration between Anderson .Paak and Kendrick Lamar. They had previously linked up on “Deep Water” from Dr. Dre’s Compton album, and “Bloody Waters” from the Black Panther soundtrack. On October 4th, 2018, the song debuted via Zane Lowe’s “World Record” on Beats1.\n\nThis is Anderson’s third single of 2018, following “‘Til It’s Over” and “Bubblin.” The track was first teased on September 23rd, 2018, with a picture posted on Anderson .Paak’s Instagram account. A stylized version of the photo also appears directly above the title on the cover art.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BoEua0-H7Qs/?taken-by=anderson._paak\n\nThe artwork is reminiscent of a movie poster, with both Kendrick and Anderson depicted as mechanics. They are also wearing Nike Cortez sneakers, of which Kendrick has a signature model."

Oh God, yes, I was impressed You was like `` No, no, no, '' I was like 12 years old Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you were on the road You wore braids with a bangin ' body Look like you did pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably But bump that, I was there from the start Even when LeToya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart Hope you did n't cry cause honestly they were just so-so They could n't sing anyway, you deserve to go solo No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle, I 'm just sayin ' they cool But you? You are somethin ' like Wonder Woman And I just wan na hold your hand, bring you to Compton Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand Eatin ' hot Cheetos with pickle juice in it Put that napkin down, you know I 'll lick your fingers when you 're finished They say, `` Hello '' ( Ayy ), `` Hello '' ( Ayy ) I can daydream about Beyoncé all day Thinkin ' 'bout the good times 'fore she met Jay See ya know They say, `` Hello '' ( Ayy ), `` Hello '' ( Ayy ) I really thought I had a chance to be your man Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand It hurt me so I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD Gazed at the cover for a whole 5 minutes, 'til my girlfriend hit me She jealous of you, 'cause I do n't love her like I love you I even make her do the `` uh-oh, uh-oh, '' just like you do She tell me I 'm obsessed, I tell her we connect Like Ice Cube way before the Mac 10 feud She 's like, `` You  fool, that girl 's rich and you 're broke '' I said, `` So? I 'm only 500 mil ' away, there 's still hope '' Anyway, I had feelings even way before you got paid And I did n't laugh when you bust your  on the stage And I salute Kanye for takin ' up for you I would 've stole the award just to prove that I love you But Jay should 've did that I thought he had your biz-ack What happened, Mr. Izzo? Hopico? Fredrico? He used to be my favorite 'til he abandoned my diva Now I tell everybody, Nas had killed him on `` Ether '' They say, `` Hello '' ( Ayy ), `` Hello '' ( Ayy ) I can daydream about Beyoncé all day Thinkin ' 'bout the good times 'fore she met Jay See ya know They say, `` Hello '' ( Ayy ), `` Hello '' ( Ayy ) Hopefully, I still have a chance Maybe if I sabotage your man You never know, hm I'ma sneak backstage at a Mary J Blige concert With an `` I love Mary '' shirt, then find Jay-Z And push him into a dancer, hopefully, they lock lips That 's when I yell out, `` Sounwave, hurry up take the pic! '' Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right Publicity like that? Yep, they 'd be sure to fight Better yet, I'ma steal her cell, then call up Affion He impersonates Jay well, get Beyoncé on the line Then make up some bogus , like, `` You do n't rub the back of my knees right So this marriage is over with And the ring that 's on my finger? Guess what? I 'm throwin ' it! Cling, you heard the sound, so you know I did '' Haha that should get 'em That should break em up like a Kit Kat when I do that, yeah, true that I'ma put the plan in motion, that 's for sure But if I end up with Macy Gray, this plan never work Yee, man, I hope Jay don ’ t be mad at me 'bout this song Start-ay, Wizzle start me back from like the first verse Like right before I come in Haha, what you say? Nah, you think it ’ ll be hot, for real though? , you stupid, they probably laughin ' as hard as you  got the best wife in the world and  Run that back, though",

Is it rocket science to you or is it just your type? One of my biggest fears, is waking up 4 in the morning and got ta hear you met one of my peers Or maybe a family member that you thought was cool Or maybe a person that I 'll never meet 'cause of you You, son of a  and I wish you never existed And I swear I 'd blow your brains out if you pay me a visit But that 's not realistic, 'cause you 'll never rot But I'ma still send this letter off P.O. Box, and when you get it.... Please take it personal Please take it personal Please take it personal Because it 's personal Let me continue this letter saying I do n't like you Scared of you but I will fight you Should be ashamed of the moves you make The pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break Everyday you remind me that you 're always there 'Cause every time I come around someone 's getting shot down And all I say is a prayer, `` so help me, Lord! '' Then the Lord talk back, `` I ca n't help you, boy! '' That 's  up, my life 's , was cursed before birth And what 's  up, I got ta live my life with the hurt Of knowing that you 're everlasting Dwelling upon the masses Of the Earth fatal assassins Snatchin ' bodies Probably, on my notepad as I write Why the  you wan na take my life? Sooner or later, I 'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor So when I write on this paper It 's real talk So... Please take it personal Please take it personal Please take it personal Because it 's personal Let me start off this letter saying I do n't like you too And the reason we have n't met because I 've been busy doing whatever since grade school I 've watched your every move You slipped up a few times, I gave you a pass So do n't say I ai n't sympathetic But you can barely get curiosity, I'ma dead it Everybody wan na know why I act this way Let 's just say... I had a bad day Matter fact, everyday But I take it out on somebody and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade I was born to be a killjoy, I 'm an old brat Conceived by Adam and Eve, so who you mad at? Not me, see me? I 'm just doing my job And you ducking me? Is mos def an odd So why send this letter as if I never knew you?

Here Kendrick makes a statement by not using a a false moniker in his music and by following his own dreams and aspirations despite naysayers, critics, and the corrupt music world.\n\nThis song was the song in which Kendrick explained him using his first and middle name as opposed to the monikor K-Dot he previously used."

Dot, my mother had named me Kendrick  a stage name, that 's the name that I was given The only thing that I can identify within this business I 'm just a good kid from Compton that want to rap Weighing my options, pick up a Bible or a strap? I never killed a man, never sold any crack All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map But this monkey on my back, y'all do n't want me to win I 'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends So just to get a dollar, will I sell my soul? I look the Devil in the eye and tell him, ``  no '' They say anything worth having is worth the wait Well, I want the world, tell me how long that takes There 's no time like now, I can cut my patience short Or give 'em some more gowns, I do n't even want the crown I just want a peace of mind, and , when I get it You wo n't get a piece of mine, wo n't you mind your own business? A rich  buy anything you sell him A broke  believe anything that you tell him Well I 'm a broke , but still I would n't listen to you Even if your hand was on a Bible quote, , pfttuh See I was brought up different Whatever that my pops said, for sure I 'd listen You said you did dirt, but I ca n't dig it It do n't concern you if you was n't born in it Oh-no-oh-oh I swear we got to fast-forward, before time flies by My new saying for ' 0-10 is, why lie? And if you ai n't trying to win, then why try? Now you can low-ball or give me high five This is I , look into my eye , I am Kendrick... Lamar , my name is Kendrick... Lamar I said my name is Kendrick... Lamar I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all Now finally I 'm ready to tell the world who I are, pfttuh And that used to be a  of a task Now I 'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass My character like it do n't carry a confidence That can marry a Halle Berry or Angelina with no cash I 'm bout to cash in my thoughts Give you a compass, then tell you get lost What I 'm bout to accomplish is something that you ca n't fathom Once the Eves come, they quick to stare at him Hoping I do n't take their , but I 'm on some other  When I 'm done, I 'm tryna run the government These are big dreams, transition from a rapper to a human being You ca n't 'school ' a dean I be tutoring artist-es, leave 'em with no audience All cause they all a facade, my God Y'all be out partying, I be stealing your audience All because who I are, Lamar But my first name, it got ta be Kendrick... Lamar , my name is Kendrick... Lamar I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all Now finally I 'm ready to tell the world who I are, now let 's go But we ca n't go... backwards",

      "plain": "This song is a variation of Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” which he performed at the 58th Grammy Awards in 2016. The song deals with injustice in America and references the death of Trayvon Martin. Like his performances on late night TV, Kendrick added an additional verse to the end of the song.\n\nPrior to the Grammys airing, Kendrick revealed he has a “chamber of unreleased music”:\n\nYou see all these performances on these late night shows, I got a chamber of material from the album that I was in love where sample clearances or something as simple as a deadline kept it off the album. But I think probably close to ten songs that I’m in love with that I’ll still play and still perform that didn’t make the cut.\n\nLess than a month later, Kendrick released an album of this unreleased music, simply titled untitled unmastered. This track wasn’t included as a full song; however, parts of it were included on “untitled 5 | 09.21.2014.”"

    "lyrics": "It 's been a week already, feeling weak already Got me at peak, possibility of what could be Situation is heavy, I 've got to prove On February 26th I lost my life too It 's like I 'm here in a dark dream Nightmare, hear screams recorded Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood Why did n't he defend himself? Why could n't he throw a punch? And for our community do you know what this does? Add to a trail of hatred 2012 was taped for the world to see Set us back another 400 years This is modern day slavery The reason why I 'm by your house You threw your briefcase all on the couch I plan on creeping through your  door and blowing out Every piece of your brain 'Til your son jumped in your arm Cut off the engine then sped off in the rain I 'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk Had the vodka on the top How come I can long time How come I could make it popular? Puff on what I want How come I could make it popular? Puff on what I want See I 'm living with anxiety Giving up sobriety Cussing with his sister And playing with society Justice ai n't free Therefore justice ai n't me Try and justify staying, obituary Why you wan na see a good man with a broken heart? Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God Now I 'm thinking to myself Hollow tips is all I got Now I 'm drinking by myself At the end of Section Park Caught you when you walk besides your house You threw your briefcase all on the couch I plan on creeping through your  door and blowing out Every piece of your brain 'Til your spine drip to your arm Cut off the engine then sped off in a wraith I said Hiiipower, one time you see it Hiiipower, two times, you see it Hiiipower, two times you see it Conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us",

You can’t have a heavyweight collaboration, however, without the two emcees talking their talk. The two spend a little time discussing the power of their rap abilities, putting the rap game on notice.\n\nThis marks the third collaboration between Rapsody and Kendrick Lamar. The two first linked up on “Rock the Bells” from Rapsody’s 2011 mixtape For Everything. Almost 4 years later, Rapsody appeared on “Complexion (A Zulu Love)” from Kendrick’s critically acclaimed third studio album To Pimp a Butterfly."

Since the money is not coming as he had hoped, he ponders whether or not he should discontinue his music career and become a drug dealer instead.\n\nThe title is a play on the U.S. Army’s Reserve Officers' Training Corps, a recruitment program typically for youth who want to pursue a military career; Kendrick reveals his own backronym during the outro:\n\nR.O.T.C.—Right On Time Conscience\n\nThe chorus of the song is sung by B.J The Chicago Kid and interpolates Bobby Caldwell’s 1980 single, “Open Your Eyes,” perhaps most well-known as the sample that J Dilla used on Common’s “The Light,” released in July 2000."

Wrong Insecurity roams the black community Homes where kids must have jewelry The high school female need earrings and details So she can be cool to be amongst popularity The various name brands that reached the price scan It 's not about the right price but more like the right scam To rule us all, confuse us all Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw Now let 's draw The picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house That lives around his neck like a white collar So why fast forward? Then I 'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times Pickin ' cotton from a field that a white man own The blacker you are farther you from the white man 's home  spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity Before your vanity, they parted our families They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed The more we were afraid, the more they made rules And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague Could n't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh And school was exempt, see we could n't have smarts And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar Four-hundred years of nothin ', four-hundred years of sufferin ' Four-hundred years of tears and tribulations, miseducation See what we facin ' is now comin ' back to the roots Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot Called us  and figured that we 'd never live in pursuit Of happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to About a perspective, my shoe selection got ta be Louie Her hand bag got ta be Gucci, it 's fake then she fool me She still bad though and her fake Gucci ai n't that bad though We fillin ' up the gas for Rollies Upgrade to twenty-sixes after ridin ' Kobes My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya He overcompensate for the life of his ancestors So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw The reason why the next four-hundred we got ta floss Slaves I said the four-hundred years we never had nothin ' Barely had clothes on our back Is the reason why when we get a little bit of change We over exaggerate on our livin ' expenses So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house You 're a vanity slave If you 're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercin ' You 're a vanity slave If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fours on it And on the back of the window it says, `` Get on my level,  '' You 're a vanity slave We all vanity slaves So with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at? I 'm not from around here, hey, Ali, where we at? Idaho? Yeah, , you know the first of the month, checks comin ' in I 'm tryna get some What up?",

      "plain": "“Night of the Living Junkies” is the third track on the original tracklist for Kendrick Lamar’s fourth solo mixtape, Overly Dedicated. It was produced by longtime TDE collaborator Sounwave, who interpolates Kanye West’s August 2004 track “The New Workout Plan.”\n\nPossibly due to copyright issues stemming from use of this sample, the song is omitted from the commercial release of Overly Dedicated, as well as tracklists found on streaming platforms such as Spotify or Tidal."

I guess war is my love Make sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing You know I take risk, dark clouds, I love it 'Cause I can hide in the mist, hop out And crush every soldier you 're with, so I 'm six for six I 'm sick with determination, I 'll terminate ya quick I lead the pack, I follow no rules I see the traps, I know you 're close to Falling on your face, unload, reload Hand me another case, explode, explode The fire of my eyes is waiting on your demise I know you hope your help is close by I will, I will climb the highest mountain Before the flood comes And all my fight is drowning in blood What I got to lose?

What they up to? Remember they used to run around while you had worked on ProTools?

      "plain": "“Phone Home” serves as the seventh track on Kendrick Lamar’s third solo mixtape, C4—inspired by Lil Wayne’s June 2008 album, Tha Carter III. This song is a remix of Lil Wayne’s “Phone Home” and features Terrence “Punch” Henderson, the president of Top Dawg Entertainment.\n\nThe track is produced by Cool & Dre. In a June 2008 interview with XXL Magazine, the duo discussed producing the original for Lil Wayne:\n\n[Dre and I] wanted to do a record that reflects that [Wayne’s] a rock star from outer space. The whole concept was that there’s no real rappers left in the game and the ‘hood is calling him home. We actually had like 19 people [play on it]. We had trombones, violins, horns, and then we tripled them and made them sound real big."

Fellow TDE labelmate and Black Hippy artist, Jay Rock tags along with Lamar, who floats on a Sounwave-produced beat that samples Bill Withers‘ 1975 track, “Don’t You Want To Stay?”\n\nDuring an August 2010 performance of “I Do This,” Kendrick talked about the song:\n\nThis song don’t only represent energy and attitude, but it represents mothafuckin' confidence…\n\nIn April 2016, Lamar was sued over the Bill Withers sample, which hadn’t been cleared. According to the lawsuit, “I Do This” was viewed as a direct copy:\n\nThe musical composition of ‘I Do This’ consists of nothing more than new, so-called Rap or Hip Hop lyrics, set to the existing music of ‘Don’t You Want to Stay.'"

I ai n't trying to jock your swag I 'm trying to better my craft and stay relevant Yeah, as time flies Hope that I 'm soaring Far from the boring I'ma Tell you why It 's important I 'm not the boring, ( I'ma ) If I think and act like you do The world would die From not seeing something new And if I do n't speak on how I feel The world would lose out on What 's really real And if I should die before I wake I pray my music will take my place The World The Relevant Id rather you call me that Then a typical artist you call wack On a Youtube blog holding AR 's and stacks Of one 's but never could be the one To rally communities or Lead a crowd of blacks Passion is to strong Im  off So there 's a chance you get  on R Kelly was in the wrong But that dont make you an exempt That dont make you a no go from hittin the fence You ai n't a blood and  sure you ai n't a crip The crowd yell OH! But I ai n't a pimp Im me, Im free as a 5 finger discount See you on the flipside Right after I dismount, if I Ever feel like I ai n't pushin myself Ill find a cliff then push myself Off the edge like a barber At the tip of your head Thats how I settle it Life or death if I ai n't relevant Yeah, as time flies Hope that I 'm soaring Far from the boring I'ma Tell you why It 's important I 'm not the boring, ( I'ma ) If I think and act like you do The world would die From not seeing something new And if I do n't speak on how I feel The world would lose out on What 's really real And if I should die before I wake I pray my music will take my place The World The Relevant So feel free to not mind me If your used to boosters Drug dealers and shooters its on wax Cause most of yall  fabricate facts anyway I could have easily cheat and let the 44 play Like a 2 on 2  But I been there and it bores me Got to the point where it did nothing for me At 40 I want to afford not to record  In my story, and Im mad young so Id rather do it now Before my careers done, this is pain plus glory Victory is here, if I cried You could see strength and pride in my tears I do it for the kids, I do it for the 23 Hour lockdowns doin time in the pen And my pen is the only thing I got for Hip hop to change the game They 'll remember my name as the relevant Yeah, as time flies Hope that I 'm soaring Far from the boring I'ma Tell you why It 's important I 'm not the boring, ( I'ma ) If I think and act like you do The world would die From not seeing something new And if I do n't speak on how I feel The world would lose out on What 's really real And if I should die before I wake I pray my music will take my place The World The Relevant",

Or see me to be just the innocent Kendrick you 've seen in the street With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat I 'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in a seat Would you say my intelligence now is great relief? And it 's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep With dreams of being a lawyer, a doctor Instead of a boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage And do 'em all if they gossip Children on the corn, stay vandalizing the option Of living a lie, driving their bodies with toxics Constantly drinking and drive Hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye Listen coward the concept is aim it, then bang it, then slide Out the  the deposit The prize on his head that tithes probably 'll go to the projects I live inside the belly of the critics And Snoop passed us the torch, I'ma burn you rappers with it What 's up?",

It served as a warm-up for his self-titled EP released on December 31, 2009, but it was not featured on the final release.\n\nThis is the original version of the song. Kendrick re-recorded this song in 2010 with the same beat and chorus, but a completely new first verse and alternate takes on the second and third verses. The original version features rougher, more aggressive vocals in the style Kendrick used when he was known as K.Dot, while the second version was performed with a more relaxed delivery.\n\nThe song features frequent TDE collaborator JaVonte on the hook, and supporting vocals from Alori Joh."

      "plain": "“West Coast Wu-Tang” serves as the sixth track to Kendrick Lamar’s third solo mixtape, C4. The song features fellow Black Hippy member, Ab-Soul, and includes a guest verse from Terrence “Punch” Henderson, who is the president of Top Dawg Entertainment.\n\nK-Dot pays homage to the Staten Island collective Wu-Tang Clan by sampling Wendy Rene’s August 1964 track, “After Laughter (Comes Tears).” RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan used the same sample on 1994’s “Tearz” off of their debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang.\n\nIn a November 2011 interview with the radio station 90.5FM KSJS, Lamar spoke on Wu-Tang’s influence in his music and career:\n\nJust that raw element of hip-hop, you know. To do what I want to do, and to have my own voice. That was a group of individuals that had each individual sound. Nobody sounded like each other, and everybody went for self and did what they wanted to do. And that’s hip-hop. Being yourself and expressing yourself."

      "plain": "“Mr. Carter” serves as the third track to Kendrick Lamar’s third solo mixtape, C4, inspired by Lil Wayne’s sixth studio album, Tha Carter III.  Produced by Infamous and Drew Correa, this song is a remix of Wayne’s “Mr. Carter,” and features an additional verse from the New Orleans rapper.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Civil TV, Lamar spoke on being acknowledged by one of his influencers:\n\nFor [Lil Wayne] to actually acknowledge what I’m doing right now and seeing it as a path, the same way the longevity he created, it’s a great feeling to share that same stage and a moment with him. Wayne ain’t no new jack to this game. He influenced a lot of styles and a lot of sounds. I would say I was influenced by a certain sound and flow and cadence that he brought to the game."

This song is a remix of Lil Wayne’s “Dr. Carter,” and features fellow Black Hippy artist, Ab-Soul. On the track, Lamar educates Ab-Soul on cooking cocaine.\n\nThe track is produced by Swizz Beatz. In a June 2008 interview with XXL Magazine, the producer said about the original:\n\nIt was a concept that could have either been for Wayne or Jay-Z.  It definitely fit Wayne. He’s representing the next generation and he delivered on it."

As your hand rotate You 're probably thinkin ' it 's safe Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace The muscle inside your arm is makin ' your joints ache You 're strugglin ' on the job, but do n't lose faith Wait... you got it back soft ( good ) Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar The work should rise to the top Then pour some cold water on that That 's when the dope should drop  the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet Place it on the cardboard, then chop As soon as the razor hit the work, you 're happy You 're excited that the chemistry worked This the fiend 's appetite This bigger than life You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night You should thank me twice Though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life How ironic... hmm Like most of you rappers",

Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, I 'm tryna get blown I 'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac Brougham Looking for E.T. to phone home Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion That 's fashion if you come where I 'm from Compton California, One love to the murder capital under the sun Young  running around the street with heat bigger than me But I do n't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that And so I scooped him round 3:30, Telling me it 's all good Tiger Woods, Now we looking for the birdy birdies Stopped at the sto ' to get some rubbers Pulled up on the breezies, Well what do you know? I think they love us And this is for the homies I 'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie Chain-wearing  with the white tee Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on And if you feel good ( hey ) Raise your hands high and throw up your hood ( hey ) Represent the city like you know you should ( hey ) I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on ( Is that right? Is that right? ) We got it going on ( Is that right? Is that right? ) We got it going on ( Is that right? Is that right? ) We got it going on ( Is that right? Is that right? ) We got it going on As I continue my day, quite copacetic Headed to my momma 's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as  Had the right grub, I bail, need some gas ARCO station on Avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited we got 'em Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions But anyway I 'm steady coasting, smoking on that Hiroshima Ashtray got a million roaches, I 'm focussed but feeling good The homies hanging on {? } and Monte Carlos Impalas and Tahoes, shoot something , break that fifty I 'm grabbing the city like I 'm supposed to Making my presence felt like Christmas day, what can I say? Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G If you ca n't relate then please have a seat So, wherever you located, wo n't you let it be known And put on for the soil of which you was grown I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors While giving you cuts like fresh tapers I 'm such a fool with it, go nuts You bullshitting like Tuck, the bounce then untuck The bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck Take 'em to school I must, this for the cool in us This ai n't for you, so what?!",

No, just put us on death row Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope Then hang it like `` right there, yeah '' It 's justice for all, but 90 percent unfair Care? No Alcatraz was purchased by a white man For 5 grand, with intentions to expand More prisons So these correctional ai n't for rehabilitation, they for grossing a bigger business Imagine We 're being used Imagine The truth shall be told",

      "plain": "“Little Johnny” is the 13th track of the Unreleased Mixtape (2011) and track 5 in The Compton 1987 Compilation. In this cut, Kendrick takes the listener through his hometown of Compton, California, and contemplates if he’ll be able to survive to age 25. Later on, he tells the story of Jonathan, a young gangster that falls victim to the gang culture in Compton. The ending of Jonathan’s story is revealed on Kid Cudi’s “Solo Dolo Part II” here."

Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights ; Stare at the sky, wonder will you live to see twenty-five?

      "plain": "“Money Without Me” is an unreleased song by Kendrick Lamar. Throughout the track, Kendrick reflects on his ambition, personal growth, success, and frustration with artificial relationships. In addition, Lamar emphasizes his determination to achieve financial independence and “walk the walk” or “be about it,” all while declaring that other people are dependent on him and not vice versa.\n\nThe song was recorded sometime in 2011 during the sessions for Lamar’s debut album, Section.80, but was ultimately excluded from the final tracklist. The song was first previewed on December 10, 2022 by a seller on an Internet forum, and was leaked in its entirety on December 16, 2022.\n\nOn December 17, 2024, the song was uploaded to Lamar’s YouTube channel. The cover art featured the same 1987 Buick GNX shown on the cover of Lamar’s sixth album, November 2024’s GNX, causing speculation that the song served as a teaser for a deluxe edition of the album. One day later, the song was struck with a copyright claim by Universal Music Group and taken down due to it being an unofficial release. The song was uploaded again on December 26, 2024 alongside the 2008 song “World Negatives” as part of an unofficial EP titled FAITH, but both songs were taken down later that day."

      "plain": "Loved ones comes from a 2018 leak from the rapper Kendrick Lamar.  The origins of the leak are unknown, but fans came to title the leak “Bad Kid Chill City” as an homage to Kendrick Lamar’s Good kid Maad City.  The leak was 8 songs long, but was followed by another leak of Lamar’s music label, Top Dawg Entertainment.  The leak included songs, demos, and remixes from SZA, ScHoolboy Q, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad, Ab Soul, and others.  This song is believed to have been recorded while Kendrick was working on To Pimp a Butterfly, because of its production.  Lamar’s vocals were later removed from the track, and the instrumentals were repurposed for Jay Rock’s album, Redemption, as the title track.\n\nIn the song, Lamar reflects on moments of his childhood with those that are no longer with him.  He wishes he could go back to that simpler time.  Lamar specifically mentions in the song his friend’s little brother Chad Keaton, and his friend known as Pat Dawg, names he has mentioned before in other songs."

Bitchface\n\nSo no one knows the true title for this reference track but the difference here compared to the other is it’s a lot dirtier and way more irreverent than the official version it also has a gansta edge to it as well."

Kendrick’s re-imagination of Wayne’s album is a very insightful listen into the evolution of his style, as well as drawing up an interesting comparison between the two artists.\n(The beat Kendrick borrows for this song originally comes from Wayne’s song “Let the Beat Build”, produced by KanYe West.)"

That is a predator, hit reverse All of your presidents ' evil thirst What is a neighborhood rep'table? That is a snitch on a pedestal What is a house with a better view? A family broken in variables What is a rapper with jewelry? A way that I show my maturity What if I call on security?

      "plain": "On “The Prayer” Kendrick Lamar reflects over “the voices of art” and personifies a song by Michael Jackson and a speech by Martin Luther King, Jr., respectively. In each of the first two verses, Lamar mentions two dates that relate to the lives of each man—The Jackson 5’s “ABC” released on February 24, 1970, and MLK delivered his “I Have A Dream” speech on August 28, 1963.\n\nKendrick uses every verse to explore how the media is quick to dismiss an artist’s contributions to society due to their personal shortcomings—he specifically delves into Jackson’s pedophilia accusations and King’s marital infidelity. In the final verse, Kendrick establishes that artists bring meaning to the world regardless of their individual imperfections.\n\nThe song was recorded sometime in 2019. Leaked on August 18th, 2020, under the name “Prayer”, however it was only ever titled “Pray” and “Mr. Morale”. Ultimately scrapped due to being leaked along with “Gotta Love Me” and “Somebody.”. Also mistakenly thought to be an original version of “The Heart Part 5”.\n\nLyrics for the song were present on Tidal for “Mr. Morale” when the song first released before being changed. Zaytop claimed that this was meant to show up on the album as the title track but it was replaced with the version produced by Pharrell Williams."

    "lyrics": "I was born on February 24th, 1970 The day I was delivered, they said I would build a legacy Picture me with influence that lasts generations I was made outta love to keep you happy and educated The first three letters of the alphabet my name I made you laugh, I made you dance, I made you sing I been around the world and back, you recorded my almanac So dearly way before the fact, me and pops was estranged My father was a public figure, bigger than life Lived as a winner on stages alike Rivers of people surely united just to see our bond Time carried on, that was a common thread My perfect father had many flaws, still they moved they legs and shook they heads in unison He had more children, I was the oldest We always played with each other 'fore they ruined 'em Told me his personal secrets, childhood, catching on beatings Sexually touched and abused, never seen life in a school The price of being iconic was demonically screwed I stood on stage and had to watch my father on the news Stress on the head of my spirit, I was lost and confused I knew both sides of the story, but still I could n't choose See, it was more than humiliation and being sued They crucified my affiliation for points to prove And now my purpose for living makes no difference to you My total existence was for making us smile and move They said that I 'll live forever But the moment he died, more accusations arrived, I had to die, too I remember taking my first breath, August 28, 1963 The whole nation had saved the date, I made it on TV My come-out was a standin-ova ', the crowd in disbelief How could a group of words be so great, designed to make you think? Racists and faces embracing my conscious in letter-form How gracious was I? Speaking on changes was outside the norm The person responsible, my creator He never conformed or used hatred to form mass retaliation Watch him perform with conviction, 250,000 souls left their homes to listen I gathered his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission His life became heroic, then tables turned My creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned Other women, infidelity-stricken, I ca n't say he was perfect It made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me I prayed that I 'd survive in the midst of the controversy How many lives would fall on deaf ears if I 'm not worthy? I wo n't justify his personal problems, that 's not my job I was only born to make sure your children can play outside And I imagine the other demons he hid before he died If they came to surface, this dream probably wo n't be alive Because of you I was born in paranoia, it 's poison for us We ca n't create with joyous ambition, we 're outta luck The critics formed a new coalition and huddled up The non-creators are now elated and outta touch Why ca n't you gladly appreciate the influence we give? Stop staring at me disgusted, my substance made sure you live You want the head of the messenger, and the history from him Which eventually takes away from the good you accustomed Think of a life without the likes of imagination that 's prosperin ' The bodies that you consider genius, you like to box 'em in The great debaters and thinkers that gave you a voice Why ca n't you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ? Because your better judgment would always look down on me But if I recollect how we connect you 'll count on me I got a theory that most o'yall wo n't allow to see It goes like this : talent does n't choose morality See, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart? If Karl Benz was a racist, would you stop driving cars? I ca n't help we jump in these bodies and you called them a god Just know the earth is just a rock without the voices of art Sincerely, yours",

Move, tell a lie Sippin on Henny, smokin on ly Never let a penny pass me by Move with the Benjis by my side That 's my sidekick, you better watch it What I mean is, do n't touch my pockets Man big debts, cut them checks Hundred mill plus, nothing less",

Apparently Kendrick has no care for the beef between Blu and labelmate Schoolboy Q.\n\nThe song hit the internet on Tuesday, November 6, 2012, prior to the release of Pac Div’s GMB, of  which it is a part of."

      "plain": "Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar’s version of “American Skin (41 Shots)” uses Bruce Springsteen’s song of the same name as the backbone, while Kendrick adds a new verse. The song, like the original, speaks about the injustice and racism among American law enforcement.\n\nSpringsteen’s version was released 15 years prior, but the lyrics are just as relevant to today’s society—if not more. With the recent killing of Terrence Crutcher, among many others, and  police shootings continuing to increase, the song comes at a time of need—another anthem for the African-American population."

They trade bars about superior intellect and expensive jewelry, in addition to tackling more meaningful topics, such as police brutality.\n\nThis track marks the third joint effort between the two TDE labelmates on Ab-Soul’s Long Term project. They also collaborated on “Blow Them Horns II” and “Day in the Life.” They had previously worked together on several tracks from Kendrick’s C4 project, which was also released in January of 2009."

In a June 2008 interview with XXL Magazine, Banner revealed that the original beat was intended for the Shrek the Third Soundtrack:\n\nI actually did that beat for the Shrek 3 soundtrack. I got a call at the last moment by my movie agent and they were having a problem with one of the tracks on Shrek 3 and needed a track.

Bear witness... You woke up in the morning, took a shower Call some  over, want them to be over in one hour She came over, you  She left and you hopped in the truck, you Took your shirt off cause outside was burning up, you Skirted off turned your beat up but your gun was tucked Under the seat, you headed to Long Beach Hop on the 710 the carpool lane Only cause you got black tint and they ca n't see a thing Your check engine light popped up, its feeling like bad luck or what not You tried to maneuver all the way to the call box But one lane before you got there your car stopped Stop If your was listening for the past two minutes Then you just made accurate 90 % hypnosis",

Tell the truth, , nobody, and that 's real And as far as my eyes can see I 'm the only one  with me Myself, so put your album right back on the shelf And let real business get dealt You ladies man like Leon Phelps I pee on any man tryna discontinue my health I do n't give a  on how you feel or how you felt Your small mercy wo n't help When shots circle around your waist like designer belts I design your face, the tray hitch lift ya up Rock  like Bobby Boucher, you waterboy What you want, weed, dope, or water, boy? It 's right here, and y'all catch up, I move fast like light years Now it 's back to the basics K. Dot 's nothing to play with A  tried to test my gangsta I pulled out a weapon and aced it My grade point average at the top of the brackets I 'm sick like a cancer patient Assist many players like personal agent Y'all as foul, clothes to fragrance I 'm the best now Plus the kid married to rap, old cats need to renew ya vows Sit down, practice your verbs and nouns 'Cause I 'm on the verge to progressin ' my words I 'm the best you heard today, hands down So hand down whatever you had Like you been in a bag Put it in garbage or trash, I 'm the best you had Ever since, oh yeah, intelligence K.

Kendrick Lamar and Alex was released in 2012 on Melo Kan’s mixtape entitled “Mama’s Only Sun”.\n\nThe song is your typical I-finally-made-it  rap song that every rapper seems to be releasing at an attempt to sound remotely intelligent but Kendrick Lamar kills it on this track, much like he kills it on every track he’s featured on. The song’s got a sick beat and a very catchy hook.\n\nProduced by: 1500 or Nothin'\n\nLink to mixtape download on datpiff: http://www.datpiff.com/Melo-KAN-Mamas-Only-Sun-mixtape.328013.html"

Next thing you know, we came across `` Lift Me Up '' It was a hit when I heard it, but all we had was the instrumental and the hook But when Rock jumped on it, for certain, it was a smash Gave it to Julio, just to get his opinion Next thing we know, the record was spinning That was some good luck, it set the coast on fire Nickerson Garden projects presents Watts R.i.o.t Then these rappers start hatin ', callin ' up to the station Ask why they records ai n't playing, what you  complaining about?  was funny to us though  hate to see a  from the bottom come up, yo In the midst of the single poppin ' and  tryna seek and destroy I had a situation with Def Jam, premature  was sour after Jay-Z left, but I did n't care I was glad Jay-Z gave me respect, see, I was young Fast forward, Hot Dollar, half the streets on lot As far as radio plays, I fears he got a lot Beefin ' with Daz Dillinger, Jay Rock spoke on it Which in my opinion, I did n't think that  was important But that 's a whole 'nother story, we hit the lab with Game And a few other names, like Juice and Young and Boy Did the Cypher freestyle and everybody 's like, `` Wow These Top Dawg  'bout to make noise '' Shortly after, Game took us on tour, I love him for that But right after that, we did n't see him no more G Malone came along with a smash hit with [? ] Mr. [? ] with napalm Then everybody start to scream out the new West And claim that West Coast legends do n't wan na see him at best I think that 's just an excuse, because their music ai n't tight Tell them that Ab-Soul said it, they can quote him twice Then Crooked I came through with Hip-Hop Weekly, killing the internet But he been a threat since death row, then Rocket came about And all I thought about was Ab-Soul, 2 Eleven too It finally started to look like the West was making moves Western Union had the whole block boomin ' because of Snoop Matter of fact, BAD LUCC was my favourite about the group Then Problem took off, another Compton native We both Compton , but Compton still ai n't made it By this time, Jay Rock and `` All My Life '' hit the airways We almost got into some major beef over Lil Wayne That part, I'ma leave out There 's certain things that the streets only should know about Shoutout to Nipsey, bishop with that game, then had a fight with Hexo That 's when I dropped C4 and had to quit They spat at me because they did n't see my fuse Grab the hottest album out then re-do it That 's a  power move, stupid, you foolish Do n't know  about this war , this mo '  To wantin ' to be the king of the cold  Lord, have mercy, Jesus Christ He 's just nice, he just slice, like a Ginsu Look at the life that I been through We the last real  alive, that 's official Lord, have mercy, Jesus Christ He 's just nice, he just slice, like a Ginsu Look at the life that I been through We the last real  alive, that 's official So two weeks ago, I finally run into the  I gave my mixtape to He said he was partners with Game That  finally told me what he said He said he did n't like it But the  was like, `` See?

      "plain": "Remix released by DJ Ill Will on the one year anniversary of the release of Jay Rock’s ‘Lift Me Up’.\n\nThere is a common misconception that this track is a Black Hippy remix, but the version circulated that can be found on the popular fan made Black Hippy mixtape is actually just an edit of this song. That version is actually incorrect too as it has Roccett’s verse on the song instead of ScHoolboy Q’s.\n\nThe original track is rare but can be heard here: https://my.mail.ru/music/search/L%20Boy%20Feat%20Glasses%20Malone%2C%20Jah%20Free%20%26amp%3B%20Jay%20Rock"

The performance is from 2014’s album release party of both Plectrumelectrum and Art Official Age.\n\nThe collaboration may be seen as unexpected, however, Kendrick recorded songs with the music legend for To Pimp A Butterfly, none of which made the final cut.\n\nLamar spoke about his time in the studio with Prince on Hot 97:\n\nI didn’t trip over getting a song done. I really appreciate the actual game he was giving me. He took control of his music. He was breaking down some things that I need to consider in my career. What [Jay Z] is doing is just confirmation from what Prince was telling me."

Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door Money in front of me, could n't open the door I 'm so far ahead of my time, I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind I 'm hardly a friend with y'all, i hate rappers, where is your artist at? If it ai n't a good picture you 're draw, do n't bring it to the architect Often you arguing 'bout who got next, claiming you 're running the game  are barely walking yet, hopping all over beats without studying training camp Try studying a few greats then maybe you 'll be where i 'm at Your songwriting ai n't great, your mixtapes mediocre You recycle the same quotes, you 're not switching the flow Your flow in the same place, just do n't rap ; elaborate Try to expand, try to be more creative perhaps My rap friends, i ai n't saying you 're wack, psyche Like an in-voice, I 'm just stating the facts, right? (? ) metaphores i write, in fact, it 's been a factor You 've feared your whole life, no TV show Do n't compare me with them, that 's like a shark versus Nemo, a gorilla to a chimp, Jordan versus Kukoč A Tony Montana with blow on his nose to a Nino",

I 'm ahead of the pack Like a high-speed pursuit We kick flows Then re-kick 'em like kung fu I 'm Bruce Lee Whether Nikes or Timb boots Beefcake the poppy, see? We ai n't scared to shoot Carry three pieces on me Like a Steve Harvey suit I 'm on my Method Man  The 3 west coast Wu-Tang members now exist",

      "plain": "The earliest version of Mother I Sober, also referred to as “Somebody” or “For Me,” shares very little in common with the final release aside from the lyrics of the chorus. While the final song explores the far reaching effects of sexual assault through a story of his mother, this version of the song finds Kendrick much more hopeless in both his lyrics and delivery. Here is asking far more questions than he is giving answers, like he would on Disc 2 of Mr. Morale.\n\nInstead of telling the world his solutions, he nearly gives in and admitting and he considers walking away from the fame, and in a much more crushing way than on Mirror.\n\nNow while his sentiments may be different, putting the pieces together shows how he was able to evolve these thoughts into the strongest points of the final album."

Character out of place, would I lose your attention? Lеt me know your intentions, cause latеly I 've been watching everybody It 's apparent that transparency never see monotony Got off a tour looking for closure, mixing emotions of being grateful and feeling like some of y'all getting over What 's a puppet on stage, singing and dancing ablaze but trading his worth? Distorted by the moneys thats made slave with a verse I feel like Prince Rodgers, I feel liberation is free, I feel I should miss the Oscars You celebrate me as the artist or just a profit A question I have for the ones around me that 's turning toxic My lungs been heavy from all the smokes booby traps Reminiscing on what it was knowing that this ai n't that I envision of a rocking in a hard place I hope my daughter is n't born with the piece of my heart break You know stress carries on in your kids reap the mistakes you made And I admit I can be dismissive, if I ca n't relate And I admit that my only commit to stop playing games And I admit that I 'm bad at talking myself out of shame And who 's to blame when the crowd stops cheering and they passing dirty looks I know understand that I 'll never be understood, blah! Hmmmmm Maayah Isolation did n't work for me ( work for me ) Socializing did n't work for me even Prayed about it, did n't work for me ( work for me ) Hmmmmm Maayah You ca n't cure this disease The pain too traumatic for relief Pull the curtain let the audience see ya I wish I was somebody Anybody but myself Oh I wish I was somebody Anybody but myself",

This was recorded sometime in May of 2020 but the song was leaked online on December 16, 2022.\n\nThe full leaked song can be listened to on Youtube.\n\nFor the “CHANEL Spring-Summer 2024 Haute Couture show”, Kendrick Lamar chose the chorus of this song to preview for the show, among a list of other musicians. He also changed the chorus lyrics to a clean version.\n\nKendrick might have used this as a way to promote his sixth album like he has in other ways such as Broccoli (Reincarnated) in the “Not Like Us” music video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H58vbez_m4E&pp=ygUMbm90IGxpa2UgdXMg"

      "plain": "“Like That” sees Future and Metro Boomin enlist rap legend Kendrick Lamar for a hard-hitting track, where the two get a few things off their chest. Lamar takes it a step further, pronouncing himself alone as the best in the game.\n\nThe track samples Eazy-E’s 1988 hit single “Eazy-Duz-It” and the 1986 track “Everlasting Bass” by Rodney O & Joe Cooley. It also takes inspiration from E-40’s 1999 single “Look at Me,” which also sampled “Everlasting Bass.”\n\nFuture and Metro Boomin first performed “Like That” at Rolling Loud California during the duo’s set with Travis Scott on March 17, 2024, just days before the song’s release with WE DON’T TRUST YOU on March 22. The live rendition featured a different cut of Future’s verse not present on the album version."

      "plain": "A star-studded collaboration. In his first single as the main credited artist since 2015, Jay Rock links up with Future, James Blake and Black Hippy partner and label mate, Kendrick Lamar.\n\nThe track first appeared on the official soundtrack for Marvel’s Black Panther making it the third single released for the album featuring Kendrick Lamar, following “All The Stars” with label-mate SZA but preceding “Pray for me” with The Weeknd.\n\nHowever the track is also the first single from Jay Rock’s album  Redemption, the follow-up effort to his 2015 project 90059. The version that appears on Redemption however, omits the second half of the song.\n\nBoth Kendrick and Jay Rock would perform this song on each respective artist’s set at the TDE Championship Tour, while Jay Rock would appear during Kendrick’s set. Both performances did not contain the second half of the song.\n\nThe title refers to events in Black Panther, specifically to the supposed death of King T'Challa at the hands of the main antagonist, Killmonger. Kendrick makes direct reference to Killmonger, even rapping from his perspective and declaring himself king; an act Killmonger achieves following his fight with T'Challa. However the title might also refer to the actual death of King T'Chaka of Wakanda in the previous Captain America: Civil War.\nIncidentally, the title of this song is a reference to the phrase “The king is dead, long live the king!,” which typically is used to mark the death of a previous king and celebrate the reign of the new one.\n\nThere are musical connections to the film in the song as well. The chanting heard at the end, for instance, can be heard throughout the movie. It is heard during the casino fight scene and again during the tribal battle at the end."

      "plain": "“The Hillbillies” is a collaboration between Baby Keem and Kendrick Lamar on which they go back and forth, comparing themselves to Neymar and Messi respectively. The cousins rap about designer clothes, women, and their fame over an upbeat, Jersey club-inspired sample of Bon Iver’s “PDLIF.”\n\nThe song marks Kendrick’s second high-profile collaboration of 2023 following “AMERICA HAS A PROBLEM” with Beyoncé.\n\nThe song was unexpectedly released on the pgLang YouTube channel on May 30, 2023, alongside a music video directed by Neal Farmer. The song would later release on streaming platforms on June 5, 2023.\n\n\n\nThere is reason to believe that this track is a subliminal diss towards Drake.\n\nUpon its release, fans noted similarities between Baby Keem’s flow on this track and Drake’s flow from his June 2022 song “Sticky,” with Keem himself calling the track “Baby Keem & Kendrick Lamar – The Hillbillies (Sticky Dub)” via Twitter. Some have interpreted the similarities between the two songs as a diss, potentially adding fuel to Drake and Kendrick’s longstanding beef, with others calling it a tribute.\n\nThe song’s music video also features a cameo from Tyler, the Creator, who teases the return of his Camp Flog Gnaw festival. Notably, Drake was booed off stage at the festival in 2019.\n\nDays later, Kendrick performed his verse on Pusha T’s song “Nosetalgia” for the first time at a performance in Barcelona, Spain. Pusha notably beefed with Drake in 2018, culminating in the release of “The Story of Adidon” on which he revealed that Drake had a kid."

      "plain": "“Kites” is a multi-sectioned song with the album’s second Kendrick feature and the first time the band has worked with British rapper and political provocateur M.I.A.\n\nThe track uses the image of a kite flying in the skies to overcome borders and barriers, conveying messages of hope and tolerance in a time where there is very limited supply of either. This is significant in that “kites” is common slang for messages or packages delivered illegally in and out of prison, most likely derived from literal kites being used in the past. This implies that the artists involved view themselves as in a prison of sorts, trying to get their message heard."

This was Lamar’s highest-profile collaboration at the time, but he has also featured on other songs including most recently “I Love Music” with Tech N9ne.\n\nGame states that this song allowed him to show listeners how he “judges himself” and also as a sort of sum up of his previous albums."

This marks the 2nd collaboration between California rappers Kendrick Lamar and Vince Staples, following 2017’s “Yeah Right”. The song also features South African rapper Yugen Blakrok.\n\nThe song was first heard in the Black Panther “Rise” TV Spot which followed Kendrick Lamar’s performance in the 2018 College Football National Championship Halftime Show.\n\nThe song was very fittingly used in the Black Panther movie scene where, T'Challa, Nakia, and Okoye pursued Ulysses Klaue and his men through the streets of Korea."
